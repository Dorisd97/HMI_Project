    "summary": "In a series of internal emails, it is reported that credit rating agency Fitch has placed Enron securities on Rating Watch Negative due to negative market reactions following disclosures by the company, including a significant $1 billion after-tax charge and concerns raised in media reports about its management. This action could impact Enron's financial flexibility and access to capital markets, potentially affecting their ability to conduct business.\n\nThe negative rating action relates to senior unsecured debt, subordinated debt, preferred stock, and commercial paper. Despite these concerns, Enron has attempted to reassure the public by stating it has adequate liquidity to continue operations, with approximately $1.5 billion of unused liquidity available under committed bank lines.\n\nHowever, the negative market reactions have led to a loss of investor and counterparty confidence, causing a significant drop in Enron's stock price and widening of its debt spreads. These events have raised further concerns about Enron's financial situation, even though the company claims it has enough liquidity to operate."

    "summary": "Between November 19th and 26th, 2001, several news articles highlighted financial issues concerning various companies, with a significant focus on Enron's use of zero-coupon bonds. These bonds were borrowed without interest payments and promised tax breaks, contingent upon the rapid increase of the company's stock price. If the expected rise in stock prices did not occur, these bonds could potentially become worthless, leaving shareholders liable for a potential $65 billion loss.\n\nCompanies like Enron assumed they wouldn't have to repay these zero-coupon bonds, as the debt was supposed to eventually disappear with the rise of their stock prices. However, this strategy was risky, as it required the company's stock to perform exceptionally well for the bonds to be converted into equity. If the stocks plummeted instead, the bonds would become valueless.\n\nThe articles emphasized that the success of this financial strategy relied on a company's stock price rising sharply and quickly. This practice was popular among companies such as Enron and Merrill Lynch, but it could lead to significant liabilities for shareholders if stocks didn't perform as anticipated."

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has suspended TW's tariff sheets for acquiring PNM capacity until October 15, 2000. This decision was made due to concerns over potential monopoly expansion, justification of rates, and TW acting as a marketer for PNM services. FERC has also requested clarification on PNM's rate authority for interstate gas transportation or appropriate authorization.\n\nDynegy, represented by Phil Richardson and Sarah Tomalty, initially protested against the tariff but suggested withdrawing their protest if TW amends its language to limit daily capacity acquisition from PNM to 20,000. The primary concern is to prevent TW from functioning as a broker for another pipeline's capacity. This adjustment could potentially alleviate FERC's concerns and make the proposal more acceptable to them.\n\nDiscussions are ongoing between Lorraine and Steve to consider this potential compromise. It's important to note that Dynegy shares similar concerns as FERC, making this adjustment a possible solution for all parties involved.

She attached a document for review to determine its accuracy. Separately, a package containing an executed contract was delivered to Patrice via FedEx, which she was asked to verify upon receipt.\n\nRob Smith, the Retail/Alliance Credit Manager at Enron Corp, continuously communicated with Patrice regarding a guaranty agreement. Initially, he informed her that he would send the executed contract the following morning and requested confirmation if everything reflected their final determinations. Subsequently, he sent both redlined and final versions of the document to be reviewed.\n\nRob proposed amending the payment term in the guaranty agreement from \"upon receipt\" to \"within 7 business days,\" citing legal requirements as justification. He requested confirmation that this change was acceptable, assuring a prompt issuance upon approval. This proposal was made following advice from his attorney and in response to Enron's request for a specific number of days for payment after a demand.\n\nMeanwhile, Debra Perlingiere from Enron North America Legal provided redlined changes for a discussion point involving two guarantees, inviting Patrice to call with any questions.\n\nFinally, Rob Smith requested confirmation from Ernie Kohnke regarding an unspecified matter in order to proceed with necessary action.\n\nThroughout this exchange, various contracts and documents were sent back and forth between parties for review, approval, or revision. The main actors in these transactions are Patrice Mims, Rob Smith, Ellen, Debra Perlingiere, and possibly Ernie Kohnke. The key developments revolve around the re-issuance of a confirmation, delivery and verification of a contract, and proposed modifications to a guaranty agreement."

    "summary": "In a series of internal emails from Cluster 51, key members are discussing several important issues related to power rates and cost allocation proposals. The first email chain involves Sarah Westenberg (PG-BPA: 134) requesting clarification on the rationale behind a current proposal that allocates net augmentation costs differently compared to previous methods used in the May 2000 Record of Decision (ROD) or December 2000 Amended Proposal. The response indicates that neither these proposals nor the subsequent one in December 2000 contained a methodology for adjusting rates multiple times per year, and there was no distinction made between power products regarding augmentation costs as proposed in the current Supplemental Proposal.\n\nIn another email thread, Sarah Westenberg is asking for a detailed explanation of each line in two tables (WP-02-E-BPA-77, page 9) comparing differences between calculations, including reasons for variations and correlations to variables/equations in section f of the GRSPs on p.15 of Attachment A. The response provides context, clarifies that total dollar amounts should be reduced by augmentation resale revenue before comparison, explains an item labeled \"Pre-purchase (0 day rule)\", mentions a crosswalk from each table to variables/equations in section f is not feasible due to the difference between JCG and BPA methods, and offers an overview of BPA's perspective on these differences.\n\nIn another email, Peter Richardson has made a formal request (DS-PP:011) for disclosure and production of any oral or written communication between specific representatives of BPA and any other party regarding BPA's rates for Fiscal Years 2002-2006, their interactions, customer contracts, and procedural aspects related to these rate proceedings. The request includes communications in any recorded form and requires detailed information about the communication content, participants, and location if applicable, except for those made during meetings noticed in compliance with Rate Case Rule 1010.7(d).\n\nFinally, Sarah Westenberg has raised concerns regarding a proposal to allocate net augmentation costs between Slice and non-Slice rates differently than previously determined in May 2000 and December 2000 proposals. The response states that neither the May 2000 nor December 2000 proposals had a methodology to adjust rates multiple times each year for changes in augmentation costs, and that the current issue is about which power products should recover the additional net augmentation costs, not a Slice vs. non-Slice issue."

Amidst these challenges, Enron sought a new credit line of $1-$2 billion from banks to reassure investors and shore up its finances. This move came after the company had already tapped all its credit lines to buy back $3.3 billion in debt due to a significant stock plunge that affected mutual funds.\n\nDespite numerous scandals and negative news coverage, Enron's stock remained relatively stable as investors seemed to ignore the discouraging news. Simultaneously, Enron was also in talks with Japan's Teijin for a coal-fired power plant project. The company was reportedly planning to build a 2 million kilowatt LNG-fueled power plant in Aomori Prefecture, Japan, and possibly double it to 4 million kilowatts, potentially disrupting the Japanese power industry. Additionally, Enron planned to build coal-fueled plants in Fukuoka and Yamaguchi Prefectures, which would give them a comparable output capacity to major power companies in Japan.\n\nThis turbulent period for Enron saw numerous reports about its financial troubles and questionable deals. However, the company's pursuit of new projects like the coal-fired power plant with Teijin suggests that it was still actively seeking opportunities despite its challenges."

    "summary": "In early 2002, Energy Central Direct, an online platform for electric power industry professionals, underwent several updates and expansions. These changes included the introduction of new features such as Electric Utility Restructuring Weekly Update, 'Weekly Power Plays', GasTrader, and a 30-day hourly clearing price chart for ISO New England (Energy Initiatives). The platform also formed partnerships with content providers like the U.S. Department of Energy's Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Network (EREN) and IntercontinentalExchange Gas Indices, providing users with a wealth of industry news and insights.\n\nThroughout February 2002, the platform focused on key developments within the electric power sector. Top stories during this period included the handling of the energy crisis by Seattle City Light, flaws in California's power grid operator exposed through an audit, and the ongoing investigation into Enron Corporation. The platform also offered sponsorship opportunities for businesses in the industry, inviting ideas and feedback to improve their services and reach over 50,000 electric power professionals.\n\nParallel to these developments, the Central American Electric Interconnection System (SIEPEC) made significant strides forward. However, a potential conflict over a hydro project caused concern due to environmental issues. Meanwhile, Enron faced criticism for withholding crucial information and the SEC was criticized for failing to act promptly regarding the issue.\n\nThroughout November 2001, Energy Central Direct provided daily newsletters to Paul D. Thomas of Enron, featuring top stories in the energy sector, utility spotlight articles, and promotions for additional subscriptions like Latin American power industry updates and competitive intelligence reports on top energy companies from Datamonitor. During this period, time constraints in electricity restructuring action were highlighted as a current issue.\n\nThroughout these months, Energy Central Direct served as a vital source of information and partnership opportunities for electric power professionals, keeping them informed about the industry's latest news, trends, and developments."

However, UBS won't need an agreement with ERCOT for power marketing until it has the necessary IT capability to become certified as a QSE. For Renewable Energy Credits (REC) trading, a standard form agreement with ERCOT will be required.\n\nThe emails also highlight operational issues experienced by ERCOT, including a failure of the main server and two Qualified Settlement Entities not bidding into the market on Day One-Scheduling/Bidding, leading to an insufficiency declaration. Balancing energy problems persist in ERCOT's operations due to outdated resource plans being prioritized over initial calculations. ERCOT has developed a solution to override the system and discussed changes with ESCA to address this issue.\n\nTrading activities within ERCOT will be governed by 'UBSWarburgEnergyOnline' General Terms and Conditions (GTCs) or other negotiated agreements. The identified counterparties for UBS AG trading, in order of priority, are TXU Energy Trading, BP Energy Company, Reliant Energy Services, Inc., Aquila Power Corporation, Morgan Stanley Capital Group, Constellation Power Source, FPL Energy Power Marketing, Inc., American Electric Power Service Corporation, Mirant Americas Energy Marketing, LP, Calpine Energy Services LP, Dynegy Marketing & Trade, LCRA --Lower Colorado River Authority, San Antonio City Public Service, and Reliant HL&P. Doug Gilbert-Smith is available to provide more information if required.\n\nJim has requested Mark Taylor to arrange a meeting between the ERCOT team and Bryan Murtaugh at 1pm Thursday for document review, aiming to expedite UBS's sign-off process. APX is willing to serve as UBS's QSE on a month-to-month basis and will not require a market participant agreement with ERCOT until UBS can act as its own QSE. Upon wanting to trade Renewable Energy Credits (RECs), UBS must sign an agreement with ERCOT for REC account maintenance, while trading within ERCOT is linked to completing wholesale power/financial master enabling agreements."

The Senate has approved a windfall tax bill (SB1X) with a proposed tax rate of 13.5% on \"excess profits,\" though questions remain about how it might apply to municipal entities, out-of-state entities, and its potential impact on system sales, reliability, incentives for new development, and further development.\n\n3. The California Department of Water Resources has agreed to pay a windfall profits tax for some generators with long-term contracts in California, which critics argue is questionable since the state would essentially be taxing itself.\n\n4. Assemblywoman Corbett is expected to propose amendments for AB 128x at the Rev & Tax Committee hearing. These amendments aim to establish a \"fair price\" for electricity and impose an excess profits tax on charges above that price. The proposed tax may also apply to out-of-state companies selling energy into California, as they are argued to derive economic benefit from doing so.

However, she anticipates a gradual decrease in prices over the coming months, with the trading price for April to October currently at $540, dropping to $375 in November.\n\nThe prices are expected to continue decreasing further, reaching $325 in March of the following year and remaining around that level for the subsequent two calendar years. Despite this potential decrease, Jen advises against long-term holding, emphasizing short-term price fluctuations instead. She also notes that the current high prices make gas irrelevant for major players like Williams, Calpine, and Dynegy due to California's structural shortage of gas.\n\nJen invites opinions on the mentioned price levels and outlooks for various periods, including April-October, November-March, 2022, 2023, as well as specific commodity entities 02 and 03.

    "summary": "The story revolves around the shifting dynamics in the United States power market, with a focus on the comparison between coal-fired and gas-fired power plants. The key development is a resurgence of interest in coal due to soaring natural gas prices and concerns about future supplies, as evidenced by Wisconsin Electric's plans to build two new 600 MW coal-fired power plants.\n\nPreviously, the trend had been towards building natural gas-powered plants due to the economic advantages of modern gas turbines. However, rising natural gas prices and technological advancements in coal technology are making coal a more attractive option once again. In fact, an article from 2001 by Daniel Fisher at Forbes Magazine found that over the past five years, most of the \"new\" electricity supplied to the grid came from existing coal-fired power plants.\n\nThe high cost of natural gas is impacting the construction of new power plants in the U.S., with some experts predicting a slowdown in the development of up to 140,000 megawatts of electric generation. This could benefit new coal technology, as it may become more economically competitive with natural gas in the future. However, even at high prices, gas-fired generation could still be profitable this summer due to high regional power prices.\n\nMeanwhile, planned coal unit retirements in the power generation industry over the next decade are expected to begin, primarily due to aging units and high costs associated with retrofitting emissions control equipment. Southern Co., with 48 units and a capacity of 16,319 MW, has the most potential units to be taken offline among the companies mentioned.\n\nIn this context, Delainey inquired about the progress on acquiring brownfield sites and formulating a strategy, possibly indicating that these changes might influence their business plans. The high natural gas prices are significantly higher than expected, according to the Energy Information Institute projections. Overall, the story highlights the potential for coal to regain its significance in the U.S. power market amidst soaring natural gas prices and concerns about future supplies."

On Wednesday, June 5th, Raymond James Energy Daily Update suggested potential weakness in oil prices and energy stocks due to increased petroleum inventories and the lack of immediate positive catalysts. However, it also highlighted a bullish long-term outlook, advising investors to seize short-term opportunities for significant year-end gains.\n\nIn contrast, Stanley K. Horton of RJ EnergyGroup disputed claims of decreasing natural gas demand on May 28th. He argued that the reports were flawed due to poor analytical methodology and bad data, stating that today's economic environment does not favor industrial shutdowns like those seen in early 2001.\n\nMoving back to March 25th, Raymond James Energy's \"Stat of the Week\" pointed to a significant increase in U.S. natural gas prices due to supply/demand tightness, primarily caused by weather-adjusted conditions over the past two months and the removal of a substantial storage overhang.\n\nEarlier in February 2002, Matthew Burrus shared an internal daily update highlighting a drop in oil and natural gas prices, with gas seeing a surge due to cold weather forecasts and short covering. The near-term forecast suggested that if the predicted colder weather holds true, the United States could reach its desired gas storage level by the end of the traditional withdrawal season. However, if the weather is warmer than normal, the probability of achieving this target decreases significantly.\n\nIn a more general context, productivity declined by 1.2% quarter-over-quarter in Q1 and remained at a 2.5% year-over-year growth rate. This slowdown was attributed to an economic downturn causing corporations to face fixed costs while business declines, leading to layoffs. The market expected initial jobless claims tomorrow with a forecast of 415,000 new filings. Key financial market data included the 30-year US T-Bond yield at 5.65%, the 10-year note yield at 5.25%, and the 5-year trading at 4.83%. Spot crude oil price was $27.44 per barrel, while natural gas at Henry Hub traded at $3.85 per million British thermal units (mcf).\n\nFinally, an email advocated for buying energy stocks due to a perceived \"secular upswing\" in the energy market, citing similarities with the 1972/1974 timeframe when energy stocks experienced a two-year run-up. The sender believed that energy stocks had already hit their lowest levels and would begin to rise as strong commodity fundamentals became visible in Q1."

Europe's Natural Gas Market Deregulation: With the European Union deregulating its natural gas market in 1998, utilities like Stadtwerke Heidelberg in Germany found themselves able to explore new gas suppliers beyond their traditional ones for the first time. This shift was significant as Stadtwerke Heidelberg was one of the early adopters among German utilities, indicating that alternative gas suppliers were now a possibility.\n\n2. Emissions Reduction Negotiations at The Hague: Over several emails, there is an ongoing mention of government negotiations regarding emissions reductions at a conference in The Hague on November 21, 2000. These negotiations involved discussions about the Kyoto Protocol and its commitments to curb emissions. The US faced criticism for perceived efforts to reduce commitments, with concerns raised about the impact of such measures on its competitiveness. A global treaty enforcing new emission regulations required ratification from most industrial countries, but without the US's endorsement, it may be difficult for the treaty to come into force due to a resolution passed by the US Senate regarding competitiveness concerns.\n\nThese two threads offer insights into changes in Europe's energy market dynamics and international efforts to address emissions reduction. The storyline also hints at potential challenges in achieving global agreements on these critical issues."

    "summary": "In California, power plants in Southern California, particularly those in San Diego, have experienced temporary disruptions due to reduced natural gas supplies. This has caused them to switch to burning oil as an alternative fuel source, highlighting concerns about the increased reliance on natural gas for electricity generation nationwide and its potential impact on the reliability of the U.S.'s power supply.\n\nIn response to these issues, California officials have covertly purchased large amounts of natural gas in secret contracts to ensure a steady supply for their power plants. However, this secrecy has sparked criticism from Republicans and consumer advocates who claim it mirrors earlier state tactics regarding $43 billion in electricity contracts.\n\nThe situation in California, which has already faced electrical emergencies last summer, seems to be transitioning from an electrical problem into a gas problem as more power plants are being built with a single fuel source: natural gas. This underscores the need for comprehensive energy policies recognizing the interdependencies between oil, gas, and electricity usage.\n\nAs many new power plants under construction in the U.S. are gas-only, there is a growing risk associated with over-reliance on a single fuel source. The lack of dual-fuel flexibility presents a risk to the nation's electricity supply as only older plants have the ability to switch between oil and gas.\n\nThe ongoing crisis in California may signal a potential energy crisis for the U.S. if comprehensive energy policies are not implemented promptly to address these interconnected issues."

The emails were primarily based on information from Assemblyman Bill Leonard's newsletter. Contrary to Governor Davis' claims that Texas energy barons were responsible for the crisis, these emails revealed a different picture.\n\nThe majority of California's power supply came from within the state itself, with companies like Pacific Gas and Electric (18%), Southern California Edison (15%), and Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (10%) being significant contributors. Texas-based Dynegy and Reliant accounted for only 9%, while Georgia-based Southern (Mirant), Virginia's AES, and North Carolina's Duke Energy collectively held a larger share at 14%.\n\nThese findings challenged the notion that Texas energy companies were primarily responsible for California's energy crisis. The focus of these emails was on identifying electricity providers contributing to California's power supply rather than investigating potential market manipulation, although it did imply that all providers profited from the soaring energy prices at the time. The series of emails served to dispel misconceptions about the origins of California's power supply during the crisis."

However, existing storage can be used if available, and larger volumes can be moved north to south.\n\nOn the weekend of June 1st through 3rd, there will be limited capacity on Ellisburg ISS due to a situation referred to as the McVeigh debacle. IT is available and offers a tariff discount for moving commodity along the Niagara to Leidy path if attractive prices are found.\n\nOn May 29th, Abigail returns with new opportunities for gas transfers at various locations including Niagara, East Aurora, Rose Lake, and Lamont, with available capacities ranging from 20,000 to 75,000 dth. These availabilities are subject to change as prices fluctuate. Downhole transfers at Ellisburg are also available through Thursday.\n\nFrom May 25th to 28th, unexpectedly high injections due to warmer weather necessitate a reduction of over-injections except for downhole transfers. Additional transportation through the system remains open from Niagara/Pendleton to Ellisburg &/or Leidy.

IT is available with a significant difference between Niagara and Leidy points, offering an opportunity for up to 100,000dth transfer this week.\n\nOn June 6th, Abigail proposes potential IT contracts for a month along the Niagara to Leidy route due to expected demand and potential summer heat. She also offers 20,000 dth of east side storage available on an ISS transaction and the possibility of supplying gas for additional injection under IAS basis if credit is available.\n\nOn June 7th, warmer weather in Buffalo will slow down storage injections, making Incremental Storage Service (ISS) available. Although currently no ISS is available, it may become available for those they are already working with on deals.\n\nAs of May 30th, ISS is unavailable but IT services are available for transferring 100,000dth between Niagara and Leidy. Abigail offers assistance in finding alternative paths for natural gas transportation.\n\nOn June 8th, the Interstate System (ISS) is currently unavailable due to increased LDC injecting caused by warmer weather. IT is operational with a $.06 spread between Niagara and locations near Leidy, using Dominion Application. IAS has a lower $.025 spread over the winter. The sender seems bearish on prices as suggested by their question about Salomon Smith Barney's views.\n\nFrom June 9th to 11th, no Interruptible storage is available on the system due to rising temperatures affecting excess injectibility. However, Interruptible transportation is an option. Abigail also mentions the attractiveness of July basis in comparison to June for Niagara and Leidy, and is able to set up contracts for next month.\n\nThroughout these emails, Abigail provides her contact number (716-857-6847) and company website (http://nfg.natfuel.com/gsweb1/) as resources for further information and assistance with natural gas transportation needs."

The first email highlighted an inconsistency in the Value at Risk (VaR) associated with TW, related to an error in the ERMS Price on December 19, affecting the San Juan basis. This error caused a significant increase in volatility for the Winter 2002-2003 strip and resulted in flawed I-I deals involving San Juan. However, the VaR report failed to show this substantial increase, raising concerns about the accuracy of the base calculations.\n\n2. In another email, a proposal was made to implement a grace period of 10% to 12% over the VAR limit for fines. This would allow desks to maximize their risk exposure while maintaining safety against volatility and factor changes. Additionally, concerns were raised about issues with brokers not entering End-of-Day (EOD) numbers correctly and a suspicion that Dynegy had created a program mirroring their cash markets on their system, causing synchronization in market movements when suspensions occur.\n\n3. A subsequent email reiterated these points, expressing concerns about the new fines for exceeding Value at Risk (VAR) limits, which were seen as beneficial for accountability but restrictive to desks' performance due to lack of predictability. The proposed solution was a grace period of 10-12% over the limit to allow for flexibility in managing unexpected changes. Once again, there was mention of issues with brokers not providing End-of-Day (EOD) numbers correctly and suspicion that Dynegy may have created a program mirroring their cash markets.\n\n4. In a different thread, an email discussed three liquidation variances related to gas deals involving CES-Dynegy, ECS, and Reliant Energy. The tagg number associated with the ECS deal was incorrectly assigned and should be combined with another variance for settlement purposes. The Reliant Energy deal was a synthetic storage deal that flowed but did not generate a variance. A separate line was suggested for the WPL variance, and the remaining variances would be addressed further.\n\n5. Lastly, an email from Katie Kaplan proposed maintaining the current language regarding retail rate freezes in the Seeing the Light and Power Up documents. However, she suggested specific guidelines for rate freezes (for small customers immediately and larger ones as a last resort) due to unclear use of \"appropriate\" in the original text. She invited suggestions for alternative language to replace the current sentence by November 22, with plans to circulate the new language for agreement thereafter."

This proposed change would prioritize a shipper's primary rights over alternate rights in other zones, which might necessitate system changes and affect the competitive landscape for shippers like Minnegasco and Wisconsin Gas at E.Dubuque.\n\n2. The sender, Susan Scott, proposes adding specific language to several negotiated rate agreements based on contract language. This change ensures that the maximum rate applies unless a discount or negotiated rate has been agreed upon. Concerns have been raised about potential objections, as the added clause could suggest that all parties did not know the applicable rate at any point and might have influenced their initial bids.\n\n3. Disagreements arise over adding language to gas supply contracts regarding tariff rights for alternate points and amendments to service agreements regarding gas flow rates for primary and alternate points. The main issue is ensuring a consistent negotiated rate for both types of gas flows while addressing concerns about potential confusion or misunderstandings if all parties were not explicitly informed about the applicability of these rates.\n\n4.

However, energy and mining companies such as FirstEnergy Corp. and Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. saw improvements in their earnings. Notably, Enron Corporation posted a quarterly loss following substantial charges. The oil and gas sector was particularly affected by the falling energy prices and reduced drilling activities. This led to anticipated lower earnings and potential profit warnings for US oil drillers, including offshore driller Global Marine.\n\nIn an earlier event, on April 17, 2001, Enron Corporation reported a 20% increase in first-quarter profit, with revenue surging to $50.1 billion. The boost was largely due to a 90% increase in power sales volume in North America, particularly in the western U.S., where an electricity shortage occurred. As a result, Enron raised its 2001 profit forecast to $1.75 to $1.80 per share from the previous range of $1.70 to $1.75.\n\nIn a separate incident, a study by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy published in October 2000 found that several large companies including Goodyear, Texaco, Colgate-Palmolive, MCI WorldCom, and others earned significant profits but paid no corporate income taxes between 1996 and 1998.

The agreement aims to resolve issues related to gas prices delivered to Electric Generators (EGs).\n\nTom Beach has prepared a final draft of his testimony, which he intends to make public after receiving approval from the IEP. This testimony demonstrates a strong relationship between EG gas prices and Power Exchange (PX) or Price-to-Exposure (PX) prices. The document addresses concerns about potential rate impacts on EGs and provides an estimate of $0.07 per Dth for backbone service costs.\n\nCraig, a party involved in the discussion, agrees with Tom's stance on proposed rates and suggests addressing the issue openly due to expected rate rises. Craig assumes that IEP approval has been obtained for using an earlier study, but if not, assistance may be sought from Calpine, Enron, or Dynegy to expedite the process. The attached documents contain various drafts of Tom's testimony and feedback from parties such as Edison, Dynegy, CCC, IP, and SoCalGas.\n\nIn summary, the emails discuss Tom Beach's support for the Comprehensive Settlement Agreement, focusing on the impact on electric generators.

    "summary": "In the energy market of 2000-2003, there were several negotiations between Midwestern Gas Transmission and Dynegy. The first deal was a gas transmission agreement from May 1st to October 31st, 2000, with a monthly reservation charge of $.025/dth and a commodity rate based on index spreads. If the index spread was less than or equal to $.02, the daily rate was $.01; if it was greater than $.02 but less than $.10, the rate was 50% of the spread; and if it was more than $.10, the rate was $.05 plus 75% of the excess spread above $.10.\n\nIn another development, Dynegy offered gas supply contracts for two different terms: December 2001 (13,500 mmbtu/day at $1.11) and November-December 2002 (21,500 mmbtu/day at $1.00). There was still space available in November 2001, limited to East of Thorea supply, amounting to 13,500 mmbtu/day at Socal Needles.\n\nLater, Dynegy offered a gas supply contract from SJ Blanco to Socal Needles for 13,500 mmbtu/day at $1.11 in November 2001, and another contract from November 2002 through December 2002 for 21,500 mmbtu/day at $1.00. There was available capacity of 13,500 mmbtu/day in November 2001, but it could only be filled with East of Thorea supply.\n\nIn a separate transaction for Calendar 2003, Dynegy's 35,000 MMBtu/d transport from San Juan to SoCal Needles required TW to provide the fuel needed. This would leave TW with approximately 20,000 MMBtu/d of over-collected fuel hedged for the year, and they would need an additional 5,000 MMBtu/d as unhedged fuel for this deal. The price risk associated with this transaction revolved around the 5,000 MMBtu/d of unhedged fuel, as it could potentially expose TW to adverse price risk on days when Dynegy does not schedule the full transport volume.\n\nOverall, these emails show a series of gas transmission and supply negotiations between Midwestern Gas Transmission and Dynegy over several years, with some transactions involving third parties like TW, and a potential price risk issue related to one such transaction."

Harlan Murphy from Dynegy Power Marketing Inc., will be participating in a panel discussion titled \"Can the Standardized Contract Assist the Market?\"\n\n2. A follow-up meeting on October 13 discussed making the EEI contract the standard for online trading platforms, with Reliant Energy being invited to support this initiative. The marketing efforts are planned to focus on utilities and online trading platforms due to their lower acceptance rates.\n\n3. Mark from an unspecified organization has confirmed attendance for the ISDA Energy and Developing Products conference on March 6th, 2001, at the Four Seasons Hotel in Houston. He also accepted an invitation to a dinner at Damian's Cucina Italiana restaurant on March 5th and will need to leave by 1:00 pm on Tuesday.\n\n4. A call is planned for discussing various panels related to Western System Power Pool (WSPP) and EEI (Electricity Export Import). Panel 1 will focus on the legal and regulatory aspects of WSPP, including its current status, administrative elements, modifications, and evolution. Additionally, they will discuss understanding the distinction between tariff-based documents and standardized bilateral agreements, as well as the development and use of EEI agreements. Panel 2 will propose discussing potential deals, allowing for comments and questions, and sharing real-world trading issues encountered.\n\n5. Another email refers to an upcoming EEI meeting in November, focusing on the wholesale trading market and Standardized Master Power Contract, similar to the conference mentioned in point 1.

    "summary": "A new feature, the Potential Adjust List (PAL), is being introduced to the E-Tag system in Cluster 123. This early warning system will provide recommendations for potential transaction curtailments during energy shortages or power grid congestion, allowing market participants more time to find alternative economic sources and sinks before actual curtailment decisions are made. Both the PAL and the standard Adjust List serve as recommendations for curtailment, not actual curtailments, and final decisions may vary due to local practices. The goal is to reduce risk associated with physical transactions and curtailments.\n\nIn a separate event, an article from The New York Times was brought to the attention of the team regarding a dispute concerning El Paso Natural Gas Company's deal for gas pipeline use. The company allegedly manipulated the price of natural gas by using control over pipeline capacity, leading to complaints from California officials and a federal case at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. This incident serves as a reminder for all ETS lawyers to be precise and careful when discussing or writing about market behavior and price strategy issues."

The points of origin and delivery varied, including transactions between the Panhandle and Beaver, as well as the Permian to Permian regions.\n\nLater in January, a significant capacity of 10,000 was put up for bidding by Cook Inlet Energy Supply on Transco Zn3-6. The bidding ended shortly, with Mark L. Gazzilli available at 310-789-2333 for more information regarding East/Gulf Coast Trading and Marketing.\n\nSimultaneously, Capacity Cook Inlet Energy Supply also announced a daily Transco Zn3-6 capacity of 10,000 for bidding that was set to end the following day. The release number was #23239.\n\nAs the month progressed, updates on gas pipeline transactions were reported from January 1st to January 31st, 2002. Notable developments included extensions of existing contracts like NGTS from Mertzon to Demarc with a capacity hold at 10,000/d extending to January 31st, 2002, and increases in flow rate such as NGTS from Permian to Permian with processing, increasing from 10,000/d to 12,000/d and further to 35,000/d.\n\nSeveral executed contracts involved companies like CMS, Oneok Bushton, PG&E, WTG Gas, Tenaska, Energas, Oxy, and Conoco, among others. Some contracts were also terminated by NNG, unless extended prior to December 31st.\n\nIn the realm of Transco MarketLink shippers, key changes included reductions in volume by Williams Energy, new commitments from Virginia Power, extensions granted to certain shippers like Sunset Energy Fleet, LFG, and PPL Energy Plus, and adjustments to agreements for Statoil on the Trenton-Woodbury line. The rates shown were for demand, with shippers responsible for fuel costs, electric power commodity charges, and ACA; there would be no GRI or Great Plains commodity surcharges.\n\nThe shipper agreements for Transco MarketLink detailed the volume, term, delivery point, and rate for each participating shipper in both Phase 1 (starting November 1st, 2001) and Phase II (starting November 1st, 2002). Notable changes included Williams reducing their volume and extending their precedent agreement, Virginia Power acquiring a project from Statoil on the Trenton-Woodbury line, and several shippers requesting and receiving extensions for their precedent agreements. The Manhattan and PSEG delivery points were Transco Zone 6 NY points while Camden, Trenton-Woodbury, and Princeton Junction points were non-NY."

Here's a summary of the key developments and connected stories:\n\n1. Transmission Issue: There is a potential transmission issue between an upstream energy deal (Dynegy deal #570332.1 Mid C HLH) and a downstream one (WWP deal #339963.1), specifically near West Kootenai. The problem could result in a curtailment to zero, causing the need for re-supply of transmission before the morning schedule flows. This issue is being investigated by SNPD and WWP due to its suspicious nature.\n\n2. Groundwater Contamination: An increase in groundwater contamination has been reported near Dynegy's Southwest area compressor station, caused by the removal of a low-pressure sour gas pipeline during pipe removal activities. The Eunice Team has taken photos and suspects the pipe condition may be causing the contamination. They invite questions for further investigation.\n\n3. NNG Eunice Station: Concerns have arisen about the impact on Northern Natural Gas (NNG) property due to pipeline removal activities at an adjacent Texaco plant. The sender requests information regarding awareness, status of the release, soil contamination, notification to NMOCD, and potential issues with other Texaco pipelines. Attached are photos of the removed pipe that show signs of repair patches and hydrocarbon stains. A meeting is proposed to discuss these findings.\n\n4. Line Work Outage: Due to scheduled line work affecting a specific point from January 4th to 6th, gas control has requested negotiations with Koch to temporarily halt gas flow during the outage. The aim is to avoid losing gas during the outage and instead have Koch make up for the lost volume upon completion of the work, starting potentially on January 6th.\n\nIn summary, there are various energy-related issues being addressed within Cluster 125, including transmission problems, groundwater contamination, pipeline impacts on NNG property, and line work outages requiring negotiations with Koch to minimize gas losses."

    "summary": "The story revolves around an ongoing controversy surrounding a deal between Enron North America Corp. (ENA) and El Paso Natural Gas, concerning pipeline capacity from Southwestern producing basins to southern California. ENA has contracted for 1.25 Bcf/d of unsubscribed firm capacity on El Paso's pipeline, potentially giving them control over 2.34 Bcf/d of firm capacity. This could lead to a monopoly in California, causing significant increases in transportation rates and negatively impacting competition.\n\nCalifornia regulators and indicated shippers have protested this deal due to these concerns. The gas pipeline group has been advised not to participate in any conference calls regarding the ENA/El Paso deal as it is viewed as a commercial matter between the two parties. However, if necessary, accurate capacity information can be provided by members within the gas pipeline group.\n\nThe controversy stems from potential price manipulation through revenue-sharing provisions in the contracts that allow Enron and El Paso to profit jointly from increased transportation rates. The deal has sparked criticism and opposition due to its potential to monopolize the market, leading to increased costs for other pipeline shippers.\n\nThe situation is further complicated by El Paso's history in California, where it faced financial difficulties following California's energy deregulation in the mid-'90s. Despite these challenges, El Paso has since grown into a global natural gas company, making it a significant player in California and the subject of ongoing scrutiny.\n\nAs the story unfolds, the gas pipeline group is taking steps to formulate a formal response to the controversy and has advised avoiding communication with ENA on these issues until further notice. The outcome of this deal will have far-reaching implications for the natural gas market in California and beyond."

The latest El Paso Natural Gas capacity auction saw significant shares being secured by affiliates of El Paso Energy, Enron, Duke Energy, and Pacific Gas & Electric, with rates assumed to be at or near the maximum given current demand for capacity. Other potential holders of capacity include MGI Supply Ltd., CEG Energy Options, Sempra Energy affiliates, and many more. This allocation follows a capacity squeeze in California over the past year.\n\nEl Paso is scheduled to hold a public conference on April 16 regarding its Full Requirements (FR) capacity allocation. The conference notice includes a staff proposal description and relevant documents for further discussion.\n\nIn the midst of these developments, the history of El Paso Energy is worth noting. Founded in Texas in 1928, the company faced financial ruin after California's energy regulators allowed Pacific Gas and Electric Co. to terminate a long-term gas contract with El Paso, leading to job losses. However, El Paso managed to turn itself into the world's largest natural gas company and has since become a target of criticism for contributing to California's energy problems and high bills.\n\nIn separate emails, discussions are taking place about an energy reservation reduction mechanism (RRM) between El Paso and Dynegy, as well as a potential RRM with another unspecified party. This mechanism aims to address issues related to frequent capacity constraints on the system.\n\nStaff at El Paso is also focusing on reviewing the Gas Plan, addressing discrepancies in reported cumulative imbalances at Oasis, and keeping key team members informed about these matters.\n\nLastly, Staff has recommended converting El Paso's Full Requirements service to Contract Demand service to restore system flexibility, end uncertainty in firm delivery, and ensure fair utilization of the system. A technical conference may be held for this purpose, possibly attended by Commissioners.\n\nIn a separate deal, El Paso Corporation is involved in negotiations for increased natural gas capacity to California's border, with Dynegy or another party submitting a significantly higher bid than previously announced. The outcome of this bid remains uncertain due to conflicting opinions about Dynegy's involvement."

The exhibit was reviewed and commented on by Mark from IGS, who raised concerns about generalizing upstream pipeline market possibilities and suggested focusing on the SoCal structure instead.\n\nFollowing Mark's comments, there were objections raised by Tom Beach, representing Watson and Vernon, regarding the removal of data on takeaway capacity to markets other than SoCalGas. This led to discussions among various parties about clarifying whether upstream gas could potentially flow into any of the takeaway pipelines connected to the SoCalGas system.\n\nMarcel suggested addressing this lack of clarity by providing a footnote for further explanation in Norman's exhibit. Throughout these emails, there were multiple iterations and requests for comments on the draft exhibit to ensure its accuracy and compliance with the deadline.

On October 9th, 2001, John Stewart from PG&E submitted an application to the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) proposing a market structure and rules for the northern California natural gas industry, effective January 1st, 2003. The attached documents provide details about this proposal.\n\n3. Rumors suggest that Southern California Gas Co. is considering reviving the unbundling of their system and purchasing natural gas for SDG&E's customers. However, these plans are currently on hold.\n\n4. There are also rumors that PG&E may consider selling over 100 properties across Northern California, including its downtown San Francisco headquarters, but they have denied any current plans to sell the headquarters. The status of other properties remains unclear due to an outdated online portfolio. Potential buyers for these utility buildings could include Shorenstein Co. and Sam Zell's Equity Office Properties.\n\n5. Jeff has met with PG&E regarding a gas capacity agreement through December 2002, but is uncertain about their plans for renewal. PG&E has also withdrawn their Backbone Open Season application due to unforeseen circumstances, but anticipate filing Gas Accord II which could lead to another Open Season application in the future.\n\n6. Administrative Law Judge Brown received responses from Pacific Gas and Electric Company regarding the PG&E gas transportation open season. These comments are attached in the file \"PGE Open Season Application Comments.rtf.\""

This meeting is intended to discuss the issue of California Local Distribution Companies (LDCs) failing to fill storage and their opposition to additional pipeline construction, which has contributed to gas price spikes.\n\n2. Last week, a presentation was made by The Brattle Group that criticized El Paso and Dynegy at a California legislative gas oversight committee hearing. It is important for Massey to be provided with an alternative explanation of the situation since Ken Lay is giving a gas talk the following day, which may involve questioning on this topic.\n\n3. The California Assembly is currently investigating the role of interstate pipelines in California's energy crisis, specifically targeting El Paso Natural Gas and Southern California Edison. The Brattle Group, commissioned by Southern California Edison, has provided a report suggesting market power abuse, while El Paso has countered with a report from Lukens Consulting Group that attributes the price run-up to a convergence of factors rather than a conspiracy.\n\n4. It seems that the ultimate goal is to present a balanced and factual account of the situation to Massey and possibly other influential figures, in order to correct any misinformation or misunderstandings about the causes of gas price spikes in California. This is crucial as it may impact future policy decisions related to energy production and distribution in the state."

The primary discussions revolve around the use of Hector Road facilities as a commercial receipt point for gas into the SoCalGas system and the implementation of a path-defined receipt point structure within it.\n\nSoCalGas and supporting parties are planning to file a comprehensive capacity settlement with the Commission, which may include the retail term sheet. However, the details regarding primary and secondary receipt point access will not be included in the initial filing, as they are still under discussion.\n\nTranswestern Pipeline Company, represented by Susan Scott, has shown support for the proposed path-defined receipt point structure for the SoCalGas system. They believe this proposal is consistent with open and non-discriminatory access to the gas system, ensures fair access for upstream transportation providers, and helps market participants plan gas transportation more effectively. Transwestern suggests including discussions on the implementation of the receipt point proposal in the upcoming all-party settlement talks.\n\nTranswestern has also requested to be added to the list of parties involved in modifying the procedural schedule, expressing support for parts of a settlement proposal concerning transmission rights and primary/secondary rights as detailed in Appendix A. However, they do not oppose other aspects of the settlement.\n\nJeffery Fawcett has been designated as a witness for a less controversial issue related to the GIR Settlement. He will require assistance in preparation for the hearing starting May 30. The main point of contention is the use of Hector Road facilities, which the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) believes is essential for accurate market reflection and uninterrupted gas supply in Southern California.\n\nDespite potential protests against the settlement, it is expected to be approved due to the role of Hector Road in displacing deliveries and freeing up space at constrained points like Wheeler Ridge. All parties are consolidating their efforts to streamline the direct testimony due on May 5, with Transwestern learning about the potential issue with Hector Road a year ago."

Christine Jun and Amie King are requested to provide feedback on these drafts.\n\nIn one email, a concern was raised about a paragraph in the open season testimony that addresses potential market concentration issues in the secondary market, despite an initial agreement to exclude it as a measure of market concentration. This mention was seen as strategically intended to prompt the Commission to focus on the secondary market issue and dilutes the primary message of the testimony.\n\nAnother email from Glen requests Susan Scott to modify the list of parties in a settlement document by adding \"Company\" after \"Transwestern Pipeline.\" He also expresses appreciation for efforts on this matter and ensures that all signatures will be correct before filing.\n\nChristine Jun has sent out the final drafts of the direct testimony from indicated producers in support of the GIR Comprehensive Settlement. This communication comes after the drafts were previously distributed to stakeholders last Monday for comments, which have been taken into consideration.\n\nThe supporting parties of the Comprehensive Settlement Agreement include energy companies such as Calpine Corporation, Chevron USA Inc., Enron North America, and SoCal Edison, as well as industry groups like the California Industrial Group and California Manufacturers and Technology Association.

Top talent from both companies are expected to play a significant role in the future success of the combined entities. The Associate/Analyst Program will potentially offer new opportunities, with the best associates and analysts positioned for success in the merged organization."

This information is being sought to inform discussions with Mark Baldwin regarding a potential course of action.\n\nOne company, Dynegy, is currently under investigation by the State Senate due to its contractual agreements. The Department of Water Resources (DWR) of California is negotiating natural gas supply deals with these six companies as well as others for its long-term electricity contracts. This move aims to provide its own gas supplies when market rates are advantageous and build a cost-effective gas portfolio.\n\nHowever, the negotiations are surrounded by secrecy, with state officials refusing to disclose contract details due to concerns about price manipulation by private traders. This stance has prompted criticism from Republicans and consumer advocates who allege delay in transparency by the Davis administration.\n\nMeanwhile, other emails show that the DWR is exploring storage services and considering a mix of fixed-price and gas tolling arrangements for its power deals. The DWR has already executed contracts with two companies, Pan-Canadian Energy Services and Dynegy, and is in discussions with several others, including BP Energy Co., Coast Energy Group, Occidental Energy Marketing, Inc., and Texaco Natural Gas, Inc.\n\nFurther emails discuss the gas supply options available to DWR from various providers (GWF, Calpine, Dynegy, Coral, Sunrise, Sempra, Wellhead, and Pacificorp), with some parties inquiring about specific plants where DWR can bring fuel on and seeking information about the facilities and their providers or operators within the south service area.\n\nFinally, an email outlines the gas supply contracts for these providers, showing the original contract amounts, current premiums, and out-of-money balances.

This product involves regular payments from purchasers and payouts in case of bankruptcy for specified entities.\n\nEnron maintains a 'Restricted List' for its credit derivatives business to comply with legal requirements, manage potential conflicts of interest, and prevent impropriety. Companies may be added to this list due to ongoing confidential transactions, standstill agreements, or if Enron cannot assume further credit exposure to them.\n\nInitially, a list of 20 reference entities was submitted for trading on EnronOnline. However, upon receiving a revised list with associated confidentiality agreements from Debbie, it was noted that AOL, Nortel, and Qwest were absent, leading to questions about their intentional removal.\n\nThe approval process for new reference entities involves the Product Control Group handling necessary approvals and text of the new products. Currently, only Birka Energi AB has been approved out of the 20 submitted entities. A meeting is proposed to establish a smooth approval process and create a checklist for future approvals.\n\nThere is also a suggestion that existing, already-approved reference credits be used for online trading without requiring separate approval from a credit or legal perspective for new reference entities."

A meeting is scheduled for March 23, 2001, at the Sheraton Portland Airport Hotel, to discuss a phased approach to implementing congestion management in RTO West (Regional Transmission Organization for the Western United States). The agenda includes market monitoring recommendations, clarification of RTO West treatment of losses, interconnection standards, potential phasing of congestion management implementation, and a new benefit-cost study. However, progress on this study may be delayed due to uncertainties regarding FERC's response to an October 23 filing and its declaratory order regarding RTO West scope and regional configuration.\n\n2. A rehearing has been requested by the Filing Utilities after FERC rejected a Liability Limiting Agreement in the RTO West filing. Don is seeking feedback from the IPP/marketer group regarding their interest in submitting comments on the request for rehearing.\n\n3. Bill, an employee at Enron, received a job applicant's resume and letter and handed it over to Human Resources. He mentioned that he currently has 11 employees, with an optimal number of 10, and one employee is leaving for another position within the company next week. The interview schedule will be set up by Thursday of the following week. Bill addressed some, but not all, of the applicant's questions, promising to discuss the rest during their upcoming conversation.\n\n4. The applicant asked about the impact of a west-wide RTO on Enron, the functions of an RTO as outlined in Order No. 2000, and whether Merchant Plants are concerned. The applicant was also informed that ongoing discussions with VEPCO regarding electrical interconnect issues related to the Edgecombe project are still ongoing.\n\n5. On a separate note, there's an updated schedule for a Commission hearing on October 2, 2000, regarding an amended application filed by Allyson on September 13, 2000. Key action items include obtaining the AG's intervention papers, understanding the status of NCNG's intervention, and defining the schedule moving forward.\n\n6. A work plan for a 3-RTO working group (SSG-WI) to develop a market monitoring plan for CAISO, RTO West, and WestConnect is being drafted. The group needs to decide their level of participation quickly, as it requires significant effort to steer the project effectively.\n\n7. Lastly, the RTO West and TransConnect filings are scheduled for review by FERC on April 25."

The Swadeshi Jagran Manch, an Indian nationalist organization, planned to mobilize retired army officers in demonstrations against the Indian government's decision to privatize the defense sector. Simultaneously, in Italy, Enron successfully arranged the first gas pipeline import into the country, marking a significant milestone for the company.\n\nIn India, the Dabhol Power Project continued to be a point of contention. The financial institutions had set a reserve price of $700 million for the project, and both Tata Power and BSES were in competition to acquire Enron's 65% stake in the Dabhol Power Company (DPC). Tata Power aimed to secure a ready-built plant for their other projects on paper, while BSES sought to prevent rival companies from acquiring the stake.\n\nEnron Corporation and its unit, Dabhol Power Co., were unable to reach an agreement with the Indian government regarding the sale of DPC's stake in the $2.9 billion Dabhol power project following a two-day meeting. The government refused to take a stake in the 2,184 megawatt Dabhol project located in Maharashtra or allow any state-owned company to buy a stake in Dabhol due to ongoing payment disputes with the Maharashtra State Electricity Board and India's federal government not honoring its payment guarantee for the project.\n\nIn other news, Enron Corporation was facing various challenges globally. In the United States, FERC admitted 25 contacts with Enron officials, while creditors questioned their potential lack of recovery from Enron Japan. Meanwhile, the UK's BG CEO raised field management issues with the Indian government, and California Governor considered a delay in phasing out gas additive MTBE. Amid these challenges, Enron's pipelines and power plants continued to operate during bankruptcy proceedings."

The key parties involved in this matter are Susan Lindberg (30596) and Christi Nicolay (37007).\n\nThe disagreement stems from Dynegy's belief that it is not necessary for receiving firm network service to designate such contracts as Network transmission resources. EPMI/EES argues against this, contending that their hourly traders do not buy power on firm LD contracts and that supply imbalance rules in the Midwest encourage them to ensure scheduled power reaches the utility border.\n\nThe draft response from EPMI/EES is attached and comments are required by October 25th before close of business (COB). Christi has expressed uncertainty about whether this is an appropriate time to bring up this issue within the current filing process, but agrees to make a filing regarding Dynegy's request.\n\nIn the most recent email on the topic, Guy agrees with the filing but emphasizes that they don't need to designate any network resource for network firm transmission from the utility, citing the incentives mentioned above.

On October 17, 2001, Dynegy filed a complaint against Commonwealth Edison Company at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), alleging that ComEd failed to enforce network resource designation provisions in their Open Access Transmission Tariff (OATT). The alleged failures could jeopardize reliability, deprive Dynegy of capacity sales revenues, and allow for improper prioritization of network transmission services for bumping and curtailment.\n\n2. Dynegy has requested fast-track processing for comments from companies like Enron, with a deadline of October 26th. Enron is being asked to provide their thoughts on this matter, particularly focusing on Dynegy's characterization of the Firm LD product.\n\n3. In Illinois, there are several issues affecting energy providers:\n   - Dynegy has filed a complaint at FERC to prevent the use of Firm LD under the ComEd Network Service, potentially impacting their ability to \"go physical\" next year and causing significant financial losses.\n   - The Intercontinental Power (IP) is part of the ARTO, and there's ongoing discussion about establishing a single Regional Transmission Organization (RTO) in the region, which may also affect the ability to \"go physical\" in Illinois next year without immediate financial implications.\n   - There's an outstanding $10MM risk associated with a potential ComEd Customer Transfer Capacity (CTC) roll-off, but the current consensus is that it might not be an issue due to discussions around early termination for large customers.\n   - ComEd and IP have filed for rate increases on Delivery Service Tariffs, with estimated costs of $10MM for ComEd and $2MM for IP compared to earlier expectations of up to $50MM. However, these increases may not have significant financial implications.\n   - ComEd is pushing to end the Power Purchase Option (PPO) service, which could significantly impact Dynegy's current business model due to expected stranded costs ending sooner. IP may also terminate this service without significant consequences.\n   - The relative size of the current Energy Efficiency Services (EES) book stands at 7.8 MM Mwh for ComEd (extending until 2010) and 1.3 MM Mwh for IP (extending until 2008)."

The California Energy Commission noted that these companies, along with others like Calpine, Destec, Duke, Reliant, Southern, Williams, and the three investor-owned utility companies, collectively owned approximately 40% of the generation in California.\n\nIn Q2 2001, natural gas volume grew significantly for North America's top 20 marketers, with key players like American Electric Power, BP, Mirant, El Paso, PanCanadian, and Reliant experiencing substantial increases. Enron remained the market leader, despite not producing electricity in California.\n\nEnron's sales and services unit saw a 135% increase in profits to $404 million due to its role as a large electricity trader during California's crisis. Similar surges were reported by Dynegy Inc., with California being one of the main contributors to these gains. These trends are expected to be repeated in upcoming reports from the power industry, potentially generating billions in profits from California's deregulated market.\n\nThe controversy surrounding these massive profits led Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-El Cajon, to question whether they were a result of fair earnings or market manipulation. Amidst these allegations, TrueQuote, a financial platform, established a connection with EnronOnline and secured an equity investment from PG&E.

The Houston-based energy company, Reliant Energy, has been at the center of these developments, facing accusations of non-compliance with subpoenas for relevant documents.\n\nThe California Senate Committee initially voted to recommend Reliant Energy for contempt due to its failure to comply with a subpoena, despite offering 10,000 documents under a confidentiality agreement. This recommendation was made during an investigation into price gouging in the state's energy market, and if sanctions are imposed, it would be the first time since 1929 that such action has been taken during a Senate investigation.\n\nMichael Aguirre, allegedly acting on behalf of UCAN, filed a motion requesting hearings to investigate unjust electricity prices in California and utilities' lawsuits against energy providers. This motion claimed that several companies, including Reliant Energy Services, were controlling the electricity market in various California regions.\n\nSubpoenas were also issued by a special state Senate committee to eight out-of-state power generating companies, demanding documents regarding pricing, bidding, and other aspects of electricity sales. The panel threatened to issue subpoenas to the California Department of Water Resources if they did not provide information on how they spent over $7 billion in keeping electricity flowing.\n\nIn response to these accusations, Reliant Energy maintains that it has acted cooperatively and is trying to resolve a good-faith legal dispute. However, industry executives have raised barriers during the investigation, including requests for document confidentiality protection.\n\nEnron Corporation was also named in the investigation, with the California Senate Panel citing both Enron and Reliant Energy for contempt as they refused to provide documents related to an investigation into wholesale electricity prices in the state. The panel is investigating these companies over concerns about their role in potentially manipulating prices, with possible penalties including heavy fines or incarceration of executives if charges are approved by the full Senate.\n\nThese developments underscore the complexity and intensity of the ongoing investigation into California's energy market, with key players like Reliant Energy and Enron Corporation at the forefront."

Initially, there was widespread optimism about the deal, with experts predicting regulatory hurdles but investors backing the merger. However, as concerns over Enron's financial stability grew, the proposed acquisition faced increasing uncertainty.\n\nReports suggested that a planned $23 billion acquisition deal between Enron and Dynegy was at risk of collapse due to Enron's deteriorating financial health. The company's stock had experienced a significant drop in value, leaving it with approximately $2 billion in cash reserves.

Despite these challenges, Technology For All announced that it would continue its mission to bring technology to underserved communities, leveraging partial cash commitments already received, in-kind contributions, and ongoing connectivity provided by FYI-Net.\n\nIn conclusion, the proposed acquisition of Enron Corporation by Dynegy Inc. faced increasing uncertainty due to Enron's deteriorating financial health, with analysts estimating that the deal's likelihood had dropped significantly. This uncertainty led to a decline in Enron's stock and bond prices, potential layoffs, and downgrades for the company. Additionally, there was speculation over the future of Enron's Forest Products Group, and the termination of the merger agreement raised concerns about Enron's ability to support various initiatives such as Technology For All."

The most pressing concern is the resolution of deferred taxes following the sale of FGTH, which has implications for rate calculations and the NNG valuation model.\n\nOn September 6-7, a Northern Natural Gas Winter Operations Meeting will take place in Kansas City for team members to discuss operational matters.\n\nIn relation to the NNG's valuation model, adjustments are being made to capital expenditure assumptions for 2002-2004, operating and maintenance costs, contract information analysis, rate case assumptions, and an equity infusion amount. These changes aim to address cost reductions from a Dynegy transition and ensure effective analysis of \"contract roll off\" scenarios.\n\nThe equity infusion amount has been proposed at $175 million initially but may be reduced to $112.5 million if needed. Rod Hayslett and Jayshree Desai have meetings planned to discuss these changes further, with the updated model set to serve as the basis for the NNG valuation.\n\nAnother issue being addressed is a Contracts System for NNG, where a spreadsheet summarizing Contracts, Rates & Revenue projects has been created and will be shared with Jane. She has requested clarification on several financial questions regarding this system, such as total cost of NNG, budget allocations for 2001 and 2002, remaining customization costs, interface to TRS/TAS budget, budget allocation for CAS, and discrepancies in the total required budget versus the spreadsheet's data.\n\nIn summary, the Cluster 280 team is addressing multiple concerns within Northern Natural Gas, focusing on the resolution of deferred taxes following the sale of FGTH, updates to the NNG valuation model, and clarification of financial questions related to the Contracts System for NNG."

Firstly, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) is expected to vote on an exception to SFAS No. 133 that could exempt energy companies from accounting for capacity contracts as derivatives. This proposed change has raised concerns among energy suppliers due to potential increased earnings volatility. The Alliance of Energy Suppliers, through Richard McMahon at rmcmahon@eei.org or 202-508-5571, is seeking input and advocating against this exception.\n\nSecondly, the Senate Banking Committee has approved S.206, a bill that repeals the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 and transfers oversight of public utility holding companies from the Securities and Exchange Commission to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and appropriate state agencies. The bill includes an amendment establishing the Electric Energy Market Competition Task Force to study competition in the wholesale and retail market for electric energy in the United States.\n\nIn a separate issue, Chris Micheli has forwarded amendments to SB 11 regarding protective orders, specifically adding a point about \"unlawful energy price manipulation.\"\n\nRegarding energy pricing, Moazzam Khoja from Enron has provided indicative quotes for three energy companies: Contellation Energy at 107 basis points per annum, Dynegy at 110 basis points per annum, and Reliant Energy at 89 basis points per annum. Recipients are advised to check with legal before quoting or using any restricted references from the meeting.\n\nLastly, back out credits for different customer categories in CH have been set at varying rates, ranging from 0.5 mills to 4 mills per kWh. These rates are temporary and will be replaced by those determined in an Unbundling Proceeding. The retail market may improve due to eligibility for benefits from transition power agreements with Dynegy and purchase power agreements with Constellation, suggesting that EES might be able to start marketing in CH territory."

The CPUC faced a critical juncture with the resignation of Commissioner Richard Bilas due to health reasons and the subsequent filing of an alternative plan of reorganization in PG&E's bankruptcy case by the CPUC.\n\nIn the energy market, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) published several reports, including one on California power plant outages. The CPUC also filed a complaint with FERC against 32 contracts worth $43 billion with 22 sellers, alleging that these contracts were agreed upon under duress during market manipulation. Major sellers included Calpine, Mirant, Williams, and Dynegy.\n\nSimultaneously, there was a dispute over capacity charges in Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) between various parties. The California Public Utilities Commission reiterated utilities' obligation to serve customers despite bankruptcy or insolvency claims. PG&E had planned to only schedule loads with native generation but faced opposition from the CPUC, who suggested imposing a temporary rate increase to cover costs and negotiating long-term deals as an alternative.\n\nIn the context of PPAs, both Commissioner Lynch and ALJ Cooke issued separate proposed decisions regarding bilateral power purchase contracts for utilities, with different guidelines. If followed, these guidelines could exempt the contracts from reasonableness reviews by the Commission. The matter was scheduled to be discussed and voted on during a February 8 Commission meeting.\n\nOverall, the story highlights the complexities and challenges faced in the energy sector at that time, particularly within California, as companies navigated bankruptcy, market manipulation allegations, and regulatory obligations."

To begin with, Dynegy introduced an hourly power product on its commission-free online trading site, Dynegydirect. This platform provides real-time market information and enables customers to make immediate trades across various commodities such as natural gas, power, coal, and emission allowances. Initially, these markets will be available at major interconnects in the Midwest, with plans for expansion across North America as Dynegy's generation portfolio grows.\n\nThis move is part of an industry trend, following competitors like EnronOnline, aiming to enhance liquidity, improve customer control, and create greater trading efficiency. Notably, Dynegydirect operates as a principal-based trading platform, allowing customers to conduct transactions with Dynegy over the phone during and after site launch.\n\nIn addition, Dynegy announced a long-term agreement with California's Department of Water Resources to provide up to 2,300 megawatts of energy through 2004. This deal started immediately, providing 1,000 MW for the remainder of 2001 and potentially up to 2,300 MW from January 1, 2002. The companies have been supplying power to California since last summer, and this agreement aims to stabilize prices and ensure future reliability in California's electricity market.\n\nDynegy is also expanding its generation capacity by constructing two new power plants in the ECAR region, set to commission 1,010 MW during the second quarter of 2002. One of these projects, Renaissance Power Plant, will be located in Carson City, Michigan and cost $150 million, while the smaller plant, Foothills Generation Station, is adjacent to an existing facility in Kentucky.\n\nLastly, Dynegy and NRG Energy announced the acquisition of 1,330 MW power generation facilities from Sierra Pacific Resources for $634 million, including the Clark Generating Station and parts of the Reid Gardner Generating Station. The sale stems from regulatory mandates surrounding a previous merger, with all remaining gas-fired Nevada generating assets to be sold by 2001.\n\nThese developments position Dynegy as a key player in the converging energy and communications business, aiming to become a leader in this sector."

It will be subject to each utility's annual prudency process and requires approval from the Illinois Commerce Commission.\n\nGregg suggests that Jeff Hodge, Boyd, and potentially others collaborate on strategy regarding this agreement due to their roles in similar agreements previously filed by Dynegy and Nicor. This collaboration is also suggested by other team members as Kay Mann experiences email issues and forwards emails about the agreement to Jeff for discussion.\n\nIn a separate thread, Ted Chavez approves multiple credit requests from various energy companies for natural gas volumes under the IOS contract between April 1, 2001, and October 31, 2001. The shippers include Duke Energy Trading & Marketing, Sempra Energy Trading, E Prime, Inc., Texaco Natural Gas, Inc., Coral Energy Resources L.P., Western Gas resources, Inc., Oneok Energy Marketing & Trading, L.P., and Dynegy Marketing & Trade.\n\nThe summary concludes with Gregg forwarding an email about the Affiliate Master Purchase and Sale Agreement drafted by Simon Halfin at Peoples.

    "summary": "Between October 2001 and November 2001, Enron Corporation faced a severe financial crisis that had far-reaching effects on the U.S. economy and the broader corporate credit market.\n\nIn October, Moody's downgraded Enron's long-term ratings and placed them under review for further downgrade, causing the company's stock to plummet. This move came in response to Enron's financial instability and its need for a new credit line from banks. The impending recession in the U.S. economy was predicted to lead to approximately $100 billion in corporate debt defaults.\n\nAs Enron's situation worsened, there were discussions about potential takeovers by companies like Royal Dutch/Shell. Analysts began to suggest that Enron might be headed for a junk rating, and the company's lenders demanded harsher terms. The broader market was also affected, as other utilities saw insider buying activity, and energy sectors felt the impact of Enron's struggles.\n\nOn November 21, 2001, Enron faced significant financial turmoil, with its stock dropping nearly 23%. This decline occurred amid fears over a potential merger with Dynegy and doubts about Enron's India investment and withdrawal from Japan. The Financial Times, Wall Street Journal, Associated Press, Los Angeles Times, New York Times, and other news outlets reported on these developments.\n\nAs the year drew to a close, Enron drew down $3 billion from its credit lines in an attempt to secure liquidity and boost investor confidence. Despite analysts' overall optimism about the company, there were ongoing investigations and class action lawsuits against Enron. Trading partners reported that business was continuing as usual.\n\nThe fall of Enron was a significant event in the broader context of the U.S. economy, marking a period of broad decline in credit quality due to rising defaults. This financial crisis underscored the potential widespread impact of corporate failures on the market and served as a cautionary tale about the risks associated with complex dealings within corporations."

The company, once a financial powerhouse, found itself at the center of an accounting irregularities investigation following its bankruptcy filing. Key events during this period included:\n\n1. On January 15th, the NYSE delisted Enron stock due to investigations into accounting irregularities. This decision led to reduced DIP financing for Enron and lawsuits against its executives and auditor Andersen by shareholders.\n\n2. Arthur Andersen, Enron's accountant, admitted to destroying documents, raising concerns about the extent of the document destruction. Former employees also claimed that emails and papers were being destroyed following an investigation.\n\n3. Sherron Watkins, an Enron insider, wrote a letter to Chairman Kenneth Lay expressing concerns about the company's accounting procedures and predicting its collapse. The LA Times published a profile of Watkins describing her quiet life before becoming a key figure in the scandal.\n\n4. On January 18th, multiple media outlets reported on various developments in the Enron scandal, including the firing of Andersen as its auditor, revelations of potential wrongdoings dating back to the early 90s, and investigations into possible shredding of documents. The New York Times, Associated Press, Houston Chronicle, Dow Jones Energy Service, The Wall Street Journal, Financial Times, South Florida Sun-Sentinel, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette had articles detailing these developments.\n\n5. Enron was under investigation by several congressional committees and regulatory bodies due to its questionable financial practices. The Justice Department launched a criminal investigation into Enron for potentially misleading investors about its accounts.\n\n6. Former employees were seeking involvement in the Chapter 11 case, and some had turned to the internet for community and job opportunities.\n\n7. On January 22nd, multiple media outlets reported that Enron was under investigation for document shredding by the FBI and Congress. The alleged destruction of documents continued, despite previous warnings, according to a former executive.\n\n8. The scandal had potential political implications, as two Cabinet officers were warned about Enron's impending bankruptcy by its chairman, Kenneth Lay. Despite these calls, they opted to take no action. The Justice Department launched a criminal investigation into Enron for potentially misleading investors about its accounts, and Attorney General John Ashcroft recused himself due to political contributions from the company.\n\n9. ABC News planned to air positive stories about Enron's future on Good Morning America and ABC World News Tonight with Peter Jennings on February 20th, highlighting the company's ongoing operations and the work of its remaining 20,000 employees worldwide. Additionally, articles featuring an interview with Interim CEO Steve Cooper were published in USA Today and the Los Angeles Times on February 18th.\n\nThese events marked a turbulent period for Enron, leading to widespread scrutiny, investigations, and ultimately, its downfall."

It was noted that historical management financials with comparisons to budget are not available, but income comparisons to the most recent estimate at that time are being used instead. The NNG Management reports represent a group, including ENE's investments in Trailblazer and Overthrust, rather than a legal entity.\n\nTwo options for analyzing non-NNG components in financial statements were discussed: a quicker method using supporting consolidating statements, or a more time-consuming approach involving separating the components and re-preparing them as separate legal entities. The request was made to present only the financials reflecting the legal entity, not the impact of projects like Trailblazer.\n\nThe sender also requested details on investments in the Trailblazer and Overthrust projects if there were no issues providing this information. They mentioned that a redo of the project would be a last resort. Concerns were raised about accounting for expenses or revenues not included under Non-Negotiable Goods (NNG) in the financial statements.\n\nA separate discussion occurred about whether to explain or repeat an action, with the focus being on the best approach to take in that situation. The Dynegy Plan was reverted back to its original value of $6.864M for future comparisons. A request was made for clarification regarding Enron's classification of a 240 million dollar intercompany note and evidence demonstrating that sufficient funds from sources other than NNG, TW operations, debt transactions, or Dynegy money sent to NNG are available to cover the payment.\n\nOverall, the emails show a need for clarification and adjustments in the financial reports to ensure accurate reporting, isolate and eliminate the influence of specific projects, and gather investment details for certain projects while keeping the approach simple to avoid unnecessary complexity."

This stalemate was causing problems for residents, small businesses, and utility shareholders.\n\nGovernor Davis took action against perceived market manipulation and price gouging by out-of-state generators, accusing them of such practices in a press conference on August 10th. He also suggested the establishment of a price stability rate for consumers and businesses to reduce rates to $55-$65/month for the next year or two.\n\nMeanwhile, Attorney General Loretta Lynch was considering an interim retail rate cap for SDG&E residential and small commercial customers, potentially extending through December 2003, but with conflicting dates. However, this decision was met with criticism due to its potential exacerbation of public outrage over high electricity rates.\n\nA study revealed that at least eight long-term power contracts signed by California officials this year were problematic due to high prices and \"take or pay\" clauses, estimated to cost $43 billion over two decades. The generators were not willing to renegotiate these contracts voluntarily.\n\nFinally, there was a discussion about whether to make further political donations to Governor Davis, with some suggesting it may not yield significant benefits.

    "summary": "In California, the energy crisis has reached a critical point. Southern California Edison (SCE), the second-largest utility in the state, is facing potential bankruptcy due to mounting debt and an inability to pass on rising wholesale power costs to consumers under the 1996 utility deregulation law. Large energy companies owed hundreds of millions by SCE have demanded a repayment plan within two weeks, or they could force SCE closer to bankruptcy.\n\nSeveral factors are contributing to SCE's predicament. The utility has temporarily halted $596 million in payments to creditors and is uncertain if its bank lenders will extend the deadline for clearing up credit line defaults. SCE currently holds nearly $1.2 billion in cash but will run out by February if all payments are made as scheduled.\n\nMeanwhile, a utility bailout is increasingly probable due to Senator Burton's changing stance, influenced by union concerns and negotiations with consumer advocate Harvey Rosenfield. The proposed bailout involves issuing bonds, and an earlier proposal for a bailout (Bill AB 18X) has lost support and is effectively dead.\n\nAmidst this turmoil, SCE has announced plans to implement Phase 1 of the California Interconnections project by summer 2001. This project aims to improve the state's power grid and ensure a more reliable energy supply. The likelihood of an involuntary bankruptcy filing against utilities, triggered by a pending rate doctrine case and non-payment of bills, has significantly increased. If this occurs, a bailout plan will likely be enacted quickly."

This practice has been linked to increased equipment wear and tear, record plant shutdowns, and high prices during peak demand periods. The California Energy Commission has reported an average of 14,990 megawatts of generating capacity unavailable each day in April, four times as much as the previous year.\n\nPower providers have accused the state's Independent System Operator (ISO) of improperly distributing costs related to bad energy deals made by Gov. Gray Davis' administration, potentially leading to refunds for generators if found guilty. An operational audit of the grid management agency is currently underway due to these allegations.\n\nA joke was circulated in an email discussing a conspiracy theory that Canadian economists may have been secretly manipulating California's energy market, causing inflated prices for cheap hydro power. The writer cited Governor Davis' resemblance to Canadians and the history of a key committee member lecturing at a university in Vancouver, British Columbia as evidence.\n\nMeanwhile, the California Independent System Operator (Cal-ISO) has alleged a $5.5 billion energy overcharge by five major in-state power suppliers and 16 power importers between May 2000 and March 2001. The accused suppliers have denied the accusation.\n\nThe situation is particularly concerning as California enters another period of high demand, and investigations continue into these practices that could potentially lead to increased prices for consumers during the upcoming warm months."

An urgent request has been made to the Independent Electricity Producers (IEP) by IEP members to deliver as much generation as possible to California immediately due to critical energy shortages.\n\nGovernor Davis and Senator Feinstein are advocating for regional price caps and long-term contracts between generators and utilities to address current energy exports and lack of planning causing potential shortages. The Department of Energy, under emergency powers, will direct power to California at a fair price.\n\nAmidst these discussions, Duke Energy has proposed a settlement deal with Governor Gray Davis amid ongoing investigations regarding the crisis. Vice President Cheney has emphasized the role of natural-gas based generation in solving the energy crisis in the US.\n\nInvestment advice from Prudential Securities suggests caution for investors with California exposure until a long-term solution is decided upon, but notes that Duke Energy may be the best option due to its low financial exposure in California.

However, a dispute with the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) may arise due to a lawsuit filed against El Paso regarding these assets, and updates are being sought about the ongoing debate concerning AB 1890's section 390 payment calculations for Qualifying Facilities.\n\nIn response to recent price gouging/market manipulation allegations, energy companies have been advised by Jean Munoz from McNally Temple Associates to emphasize that they did not create or regulate the market and have invested billions of dollars in California power plants after being invited under AB 1890. The crisis was caused by a lack of long-term contracts, supply shortages, and the absence of a retail market. However, Munoz also highlights that energy companies have made efforts to keep plants running during the crisis and are investing private-sector dollars in building new power plants in California to generate electricity and improve air quality.\n\nOverall, these discussions and negotiations aim to find solutions for California's electricity supply issues, ensuring reliable and affordable electricity for consumers in the long run."

Halvorsen, president of Interstate Natural Gas Association of America (INGAA), expects FERC to closely monitor the situation and take swift action if any irregularities are found in the market. INGAA views this as a serious effort by FERC to better understand the California gas market, while others see it as FERC merely appeasing federal and California lawmakers. The email also mentions that Dynegy's chief attorney was quoted in the Daily GPI on May 22.\n10. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) will discuss the investigation into California's energy issues as part of their upcoming agenda, specifically Item E-2. Notably, FERC has expressed the possibility of removing this item from the agenda, which is unusual for them to do so explicitly. The investigation includes several complaints, such as those from San Diego, EOB, CMUA, CARE, Puget, and Reliant/Dynegy, regarding export restrictions during system emergencies."

    "summary": "In Cluster 353, several key developments occurred over the course of a few days:\n\n1. **Consumers Demand for Arbitration**: Andy Edison was informed about consumers initiating an arbitration process over a dispute. Marcus will keep all parties updated on its progress and any attempts to commercially settle this issue. A letter-fax from the consumers regarding their demand for Arbitration was attached in the email.\n\n2. **FERC Complaint Against PX**: Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. filed a complaint at FERC (Federal Energy Regulatory Commission) regarding EL00-95-000, specifically the San Diego complaint proceeding. Nine companies have joined as signatories on the complaint, but others are encouraged to intervene ASAP in support of the complaint. The goal is to request an immediate suspension of chargeback payments, with Enron asking FERC to suspend the chargeback no later than February 14th.\n\n3. **Revised Complaint Against CalPX**: A revised version of a complaint against CalPX was attached for review by Sempra Energy Trading. Interested parties were asked to join the complaint by 1:00 pm on the same day, and contact information for several individuals was requested for outreach purposes.\n\n4. **EOB Injunction**: Katie Kaplan advised recipients of a potential conflict of interest as Executive Director of Independent Energy Producers and Chairman of the Board for the ISO. She discussed a subpoena filed by EOB to access confidential market data from ISO, suggesting that some may plan to file an injunction to prevent this requirement. Jan Smutny-Jones expressed opposition to the injunction and offered alternative legal means to protect confidentiality.\n\n5. **Invoice 11-AR-9281-9PC**: An invoice of $61,621.83 was sent to Jaime Sanabria of EcoElectrica for payment. Debbie Alleyne was asked to follow up with Mr. Sanabria about the delayed payment and report back on the status.\n\n6. **Strategy for Transferring Class Actions to FERC**: Joel Newton proposed a meeting later this week with Dan and Randy to coordinate efforts regarding a case involving several companies, seeking input from FERC and the legislative teams. The goal is to have FERC intervene in pending class action suits against these companies, specifically opposing motions to remand to state court and supporting referral from the U.S. District Court to FERC. An attached document outlines a White House and DOE/FERC strategy for this purpose, and any suggestions to improve the strategy were requested."

On August 23, the Transmission System Work Group (TSWG) discussed several topics related to system improvements, including updates for the Automated Dispatch System (ADS) and 10-Minute Settlement. Notable changes in ADS include the release of the ADS Query File Data Dictionary with improved performance and decimal values, as well as a shift from block energy to ramping energy for dispatches since June 1st. Starting September 1st, residual energy will be utilized instead. The implementation date for Inter-SC trades of adjustment bids was not specified.\n\n2. A conference call is scheduled for August 30th, 2000, to discuss the technical details and draft implementation schedule for the 10-Minute Settlement Market Simulation II. Settlements and scheduling personnel are requested to attend. The simulation aims to identify potential issues affecting both the ISO and market participants before implementation.\n\n3. A second round of the 10-Minute Settlement Market Simulation was scheduled for August 1, 2000, with a kickoff meeting on July 27th. However, due to additional testing and market simulation, the initial implementation date has been postponed to the last week of August. Participants are encouraged to respond by 3:00 p.m. on Friday, July 28th, if they intend to participate.\n\n4. The Tennessee Power Order on Interconnection Policy issued by FERC was discussed in an email from Christi L Nicolay. It was highlighted that merchant facilities, a relatively new concept and not rate-based, face issues with utilities not providing timely results regarding interconnection agreements.\n\n5. A conference call took place about California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) subpoenas issued to New West and its parent Salt River, while APX did not receive one. Generators are coordinating weekly in response, led by Joe Paul of Dynegy. They are considering filing a motion to quash, addressing issues such as jurisdiction, information sharing, PR and legal concerns, and potential differences between ESP (Energy Services Performance) and SC (Service Class) matters.\n\n6. An EPSA meeting was held with FERC's Office of Markets Rates and Tariffs staff to address the lack of comparable transmission service between network and point-to-point service. The issue was shown to be a concern for all transmission customers, not just generators. A follow-up meeting has been scheduled with FERC's Andrea Wolfman and Ginny Strasser."

The New York Independent System Operator (NYISO) received an extension for its Automated Mitigation Procedures until April 30, 2002, following approval from FERC. However, FERC has directed the NYISO to submit a comprehensive mitigation proposal addressing concerns with the procedures and their interaction with other measures by March 1. The proposal should also address potential barriers for new generation entry, inconsistencies between the AMP and other measures, and must-run mitigation measures similar to those used by ISO-NE and PJM, particularly regarding transmission constraints within NYC.\n\n2. Chad Wagner of Dynegy expressed concerns about the NYISO using limited resources on a study not prioritized by members, suggesting that the ISO should primarily focus on facilitating a workable, reliable, and efficient power market.\n\n3. Glen Perez from CA ISO shared a draft description of a new Demand Responsiveness program called the Discretionary Load Curtailment Program (DLCP). The recipient was requested to review the attached document and send comments by March 12th.\n\n4. A conference call was arranged for discussion on three main points:\n   - Attending an EPSA/FERC meeting, focusing on Enron's participation and ensuring the issues are outlined effectively.\n   - Meeting with Scott Miller in California to discuss unspecified messages and finding out who he is meeting with.\n   - Gathering more information from the CA ISO for an upcoming AG investigation, addressing concerns about potential accessibility of information and using the investigation as a chance to request additional information from the CA ISO.\n\n5. Scott Miller (FERC) was in California meeting with people and discussing proposed rate freezes. There is concern about increased pressure on FERC due to an ongoing investigation. Two meetings next week were scheduled for discussion on California-related issues, with generators on August 23 and marketers on August 24. FERC will have additional meetings on other areas of interest.\n\n6. Mike Dozier, ISO Manager of Contracts, requested assistance in distributing a letter to the Independent Energy Producers Association (IEP) members. The letter explains that starting June 1, 2001, Generating Units providing or intending to provide Ancillary Services (other than Regulation) must use Data Processing Gateway (DPG) technology for direct telemetry. This notice is crucial for owners of Generating Units operating under existing power purchase agreements, as they need to plan and budget for the installation of DPG technology in a timely manner, before agreement termination. Additionally, an ISO stakeholder meeting on December 7 was scheduled to discuss DPG requirements, among other matters."

No Natural Gas/Oil report was issued during that period.\n\nIn a separate email, GRS also announced the creation of a Power Market Oversight Unit by FERC. The email included daily natural gas prices across various regions and futures for Henry Hub, as well as risk management services provided by e-Acumen, Inc.\n\nThroughout this period, there was an ongoing issue regarding Dynegy's (Coral, etc.) request for rehearing of a Southern source and sink approval. Additionally, plans were made to potentially file a complaint against Southern for selling parking-type services. EPMI was considering intervention but chose not to due to a pending sale of Caledonia to Cinergy, which had recently been approved by FERC.\n\nTo capitalize on potential retail and commercial opportunities outside the Northeast region, relevant team members were alerted about various filings and agreements of interest in the East region. The emails concluded with attachments containing the Weekly Electric FERC Report for each respective week.\n\nThe storyline highlights the strategic importance of monitoring FERC activities and their impact on utility companies, as well as the need to seize potential business opportunities arising from these developments. The events suggest a competitive landscape where companies strive for market share, challenge regulatory decisions when necessary, and adapt their strategies based on mergers and acquisitions in the industry."

Here's a summary of the key events:\n\n1. Dick successfully traded 5,000 units of Columbia Gas Transmission Capacity with Dynegy for December 2000, and the related release was posted without issues. Scott acknowledged the efforts put into setting up pipeline capacity as a product on EOL (Electronic Over-the-Counter trading platform).\n\n2. Leslie informed the team about the use of specific Master Agreements for both physical gas and financial transactions instead of online General Terms and Conditions, according to ENA's Electronic Trading Agreement. The specified contracts are the Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement dated July 1, 1993 for natural gas transactions and the Master Agreement dated January 27, 1992 for financial transactions.\n\n3. Jackie Young requested Daren to extend Deal #422516 to cover flow on December 6th for October 6th and extend deal 432556 to cover flow on December 24th for October 19th. These adjustments are needed to clear up issues with the Dynegy deal, as Jackie had already placed correct volumes for days 6 and 9 for ENA but is waiting for Victor to extend the deal so that Sherlyn can create an accounting arrangement.\n\n4. In a subsequent email, Jackie clarified that she extended Deal #421415, but mistakenly sent the request to Victor who is not involved in this matter. She asked Victor to extend the same deal for Dynegy when ready, so that Sherlyn can create an accounting arrangement.\n\n5. An incomplete intercompany deal involving HPL, Dynegy, and ENA on the Oasis Pipeline meter 1335 is causing issues with their intercompany report and needs resolution by the end of the month. Stacey has been asked to investigate this matter.\n\n6. Judy Thorne from Enron Upstream Company LLC forwarded a sample of their GISB (General Intermediate Shelf Borrowing) to Kent for review, following their discussion. Kent is encouraged to contact Judy with any questions regarding the enclosed document.\n\nOverall, these emails demonstrate various transactions and deals being managed within Cluster 357, including pipeline capacity trades, intercompany deals, and financial agreements. Issues related to volume allocation, accounting arrangements, and resolving discrepancies are also apparent in the communication chain."

This decision was based on a call received from credit and a document from Bruce Mills stating that all deals with Dynegy Canada should be processed through ECC instead of ENA.\n\nStacey Vallejo then requested immediate action to adjust the terms of a specific deal, associated with Dynegy Canada, to the FT-US/CAND-ERMS book. This change was necessary because all deals involving Dynegy Canada must now be settled with ECC instead of ENA, effective from February 6, 2001. Stacey encouraged questions for clarification if needed.\n\nRegarding trading agreements, it was confirmed that Dynegy Canada's trading activities would predominantly involve the ECC. Instead of having two separate ISDA Master Agreements, an agreement would be made between ECC and Dynegy Canada, and any subsequent trades with ENA would be back-to-back through the existing Services Agreement. This structure would also apply to End-of-Life (EOL) trades due to the Electronic Trading Agreement's terms, which permit financial trades to be transacted under the respective master agreements in place with either ECC or ENA.\n\nLastly, it was noted that there were existing agreements with ENA, EPMI, and possibly EES for TradeSpark. However, the status of the EES agreement, negotiated by Will F, needed to be checked. Additionally, Pat Kokes from Dynegy had inquired about Electronic Trading Agreements with Tradesbark for Enron's subsidiaries and requested a call back."

This decision comes in response to concerns raised by a previous Joskow/Kahn paper about price above cost analysis and withholding, particularly in relation to Enron's interests. The team is also looking to engage in discussions through EPSA, WPTF, and IEP of CA to challenge related studies and analyses following a recent order.\n\nJeff Dasovich suggests that insights from the Hogan paper, particularly on market power, could be beneficial in assessing the Joskow/Kahn analysis. Economist Seabron Adamson is mentioned as someone who might do analysis related to this. Another email discusses a critique of the recent market power studies in California's energy market by Harvey & Hogan and raises concerns about similar mistakes made in a more recent paper by Paul Joskow and Ed Kahn.\n\nIn addition, Will McNamara announced the launch of SourceBook Weekly, a weekly e-zine providing analytical summaries on key energy industry issues such as deregulation, trading, T&D, generation, new technologies, e-commerce, and international privatization. The first two articles featured in this week's issue discuss the future of the Midwestern Transmission Grid (MISO) and FERC's proposed order to repair California's electricity market issues.\n\nAt a MISO Meeting last week, Market Power and Market Monitoring issues were discussed, with David Patton from Potomac Economics providing insights on the proposed establishment of a market monitoring organization, focus on ensuring overall market functionality rather than just market power, and consideration of demand side response to mitigate market power. Concerns about potential market power in Michigan Peninsula were raised, with disagreement on assuming all generators have market power unless proven otherwise."

California Assemblyman Dennis Cardoza plans to introduce a bill (the \"three strikes\" bill) on April 25th that would make it a felony for energy suppliers in California to manipulate the market or drive up prices, subjecting offenders to the state's three-strikes law. Lawmakers are discussing power contracts and alternative energy bills while negotiating with power providers like Reliant and federal regulators. California is also considering federal price controls as a solution, but there is ongoing debate on this topic. Meanwhile, the energy crisis has impacted various industries, including entertainment venues experiencing blackouts.

Facing an accumulated debt of over $12 billion in electricity purchases, Davis proposed a plan to buy power lines but required federal approval for this deal. However, critics argued that this move might not align with the Republican administration's preference for market-driven strategies, leading to concerns about federal veto power.\n\nDespite these challenges, Davis remained optimistic about securing support from the Bush administration for his proposal. To address the electricity overcharge issue, Davis publicly demanded nearly $9 billion in refunds from power generators, accusing them of excessive billing. This demand followed a Senate hearing where Davis criticized federal regulators for failing to address past overcharges and enabling price gouging by out-of-state power generators.\n\nIn response to the crisis, Davis also announced support for electricity rate increases and unveiled a tiered rate plan. However, this move faced complications when a U.S. court ruling prevented a big generator from being forced to sell emergency power to the state, potentially exacerbating the supply situation. Additionally, concerns were raised over partial payments made by Pacific Gas & Electric Co. to suppliers and overspending of $98 million by San Diego's utility, which was under scrutiny.\n\nOther news articles reported on the impact of the crisis on families facing potential power cutoffs, Western states sharing electricity shortages, and the performance of energy-related firms on the Fortune 500 list (with Enron mentioned). Governor Davis also sent a letter to Secretary of Energy Abraham, updating him on California's energy conservation and efficiency efforts and mentioning that the state used 2,000 fewer megawatts in January due to these initiatives.\n\nThroughout this period, Sue Mara from Enron Corp. was among those closely monitoring developments, as polling and focus groups indicated positive public response towards addressing the refund issue. The situation seemed poised to lead to regional price caps being imposed soon, and discussions about selling power lines and generating ideas for deregulation continued as potential solutions to California's energy problems."

However, there may be indirect effects due to Enron's current situation. Both Enron and Dynegy are committed to the PGE transaction, but it is uncertain if Dynegy will need to file a separate application due to potential SEC issues and ongoing analysis of Oregon law regarding their involvement. The Enron/Dynegy merger is expected to close in Q3 2002, while the NWN/PGE transaction's regulatory approvals are still being processed.\n\nA bind contract exists between NWN and Enron for PGE, with only Dynegy as a suitor at this point. There are concerns about potential issues if Dynegy completes the Enron purchase before Enron sells PGE to NWN, as it may lead to SEC problems under PUHCA.\n\nAn unauthorized press release about the Enron/Dynegy merger from an European PR team has caused upset in London and had to be withdrawn. It was emphasized that all future press releases must be coordinated and approved by Adam Umanoff to avoid such incidents.\n\nLastly, Delia Walters expressed her concern about Enron's merger with Dynegy and suggested a company-wide fundraiser to help the struggling firm. Ken Lay agreed that the merger was necessary but did not address the fundraising idea directly. Later, Delia praised Ken for his efforts at Enron and expressed regret about the impending end of her employment, hoping that Dynegy would appreciate the talented staff they are gaining."

    "summary": "The Dow Jones Newswires article discusses the ongoing issue of power price gouging in California, with Governor Gray Davis claiming an overcharge of approximately $9 billion. However, according to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), they only have the potential authority to order refunds for around $3.3 billion. The remaining overcharges, amounting to nearly half of the total claim, are attributed to municipal utilities outside FERC's jurisdiction. Negotiations between power generators and state officials are underway, with expectations of refunds but less than the $9 billion sought by Davis."

    "summary": "In a series of emails from Cluster 372, discussions centered around two main topics: California energy regulations and reports issued by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).\n\nIn the context of California energy regulations, concerns were raised about the application of price caps in the market. Specifically, there was a debate over whether the caps apply to bilateral contracts and forward markets. Commissioner Massey questioned the capping of the forward market and suggested an accepted forward contract for a specified timeframe. There was also discussion on the test to be used by the commission in reviewing transactions above the soft cap, as well as suggestions that penalties should be applied to both the load and supply side. Some participants argued that the load cannot meet the 5% test.\n\nRegarding FERC reports, favorable results were reported for two periods in 2000: November and December. The pricing report showed that prices in the Northwest during these months tracked increased demand and supply shortfall, while the outage report found no evidence that plants were down for reasons other than maintenance or emissions problems.\n\nIn summary, key players discussed issues related to price caps and forward contracts in California's energy market following a November 20 meeting. Commissioner Massey expressed reservations about capping the forward market, and there was debate on the test used by the commission for transactions above the soft cap, with suggestions for temporary and escalating caps. Meanwhile, FERC reported favorable results from their assessments of plant outages in California and Northwest power markets during November and December 2000."

The panelists held various opinions, with Dynegy opposing standardization and urging FERC guidance should be provided for stakeholders to address inconsistencies. Dominion advocated a more prescriptive approach from FERC for RTO West's assigning transmission service responsibility to either generating company or its customers, which may not accurately reflect potential third-party involvement. The agreement suggested amending to consider this scenario.\n2. Some generators resist the \"good utility\" practice standard and refusing to sign the WSCC Reliability Management System Agreement.

    "summary": "In a series of emails within Cluster 376, several key developments were discussed related to energy production, interconnection agreements, and regional transmission organizations.\n\nOn July 31, 2000, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) approved the Southwest Power Pool's (SPP) interconnection procedures. These procedures allow for third-party studies to be used in the interconnection process but do not obligate SPP to permit them if time constraints are an issue. If a study takes more than 60 days, SPP must provide notice but is not bound by this timeline. If transmission is not purchased, the customer is responsible for any necessary upgrades, unless transmission is requested later. FERC suggests that system-benefiting network upgrades should be paid for in rates for all customers.\n\nRegarding a potential interconnection agreement with VEPCO, several concerns were raised. These included potential costs associated with emergency power requirements and the need to ensure optionality in selling energy to third parties due to potential transmission constraints. The process of interconnecting generation is separate from requesting transmission, and Enron was advised to discuss these transmission matters with Kevin Presto's team.\n\nThere were also discussions about a potential merger of California's Independent System Operator (CAISO) and the Desert Southwest regions into a single Regional Transmission Organization (RTO). The parties agreed on consolidating control areas, migrating to common market protocols quickly, creating an independent RTO governing board, and moving from regional advisory committees to a single advisory committee structure. There were no significant obstacles at this time for most issues.\n\nIn summary, the emails discuss FERC's approval of SPP's interconnection procedures, potential issues with an interconnection agreement with VEPCO, and a positive meeting between CAISO, Desert Southwest market participants, and transmission owners regarding the potential merger of California and the Desert Southwest regions into a single RTO."

    "summary": "In the span of several days during late June 2001, various internal emails at Cluster 378 detailed key strategic discussions related to regulatory actions by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and their potential impacts on energy and natural gas companies.\n\nShelley Corman alerted colleagues about an upcoming FERC conference aimed at promoting market liquidity, where she expressed concerns over tightened tolerances and affiliate practices in pipelines potentially becoming more restrictive. Companies such as BP/Amoco and Dynegy were anticipated to be aggressive during the January conference and strategies to counter their arguments were advised.\n\nIn a separate call hosted by Ray Niles, President & COO of Dynegy, Steve Bergstrom discussed the recent FERC action imposing price controls in the West, covering its implications for Dynegy, potential risks of further re-regulation, and related questions. The call concluded with a Q&A session and was followed by a two-day replay.\n\nAnother email concerned an upcoming meeting with FERC regarding concerns over Independent System Operator (ISO) scheduling practices raised by Mirant and others. Debra Bolton, counsel for Mirant, planned to attend, and the meeting was intended to be informal through mediation rather than formal complaints. Key personnel were encouraged to participate in this meeting. While some companies like Williams and Reliant viewed it positively, Dynegy appeared less optimistic.\n\nSubsequently, Enron arranged a meeting later that day involving multiple parties, including Joseph, to discuss Enron's current status with EPSa and WPTF, as well as potential filings regarding FERC Staff's market monitoring proposal. The new employee, Ray Alvarez, was also introduced during the discussion, and all members were asked to review the attached preliminary draft of WPTF comments on the staff proposal to ensure consistency and enrich the final filing with additional policy arguments.\n\nFinally, Sue Mara from Enron Corp recommended joining Dynegy's expedited motion by 1pm EDT the next day regarding the enforcement action against CAISO for noncompliance with FERC orders on creditworthiness and tariff provisions. Additionally, a recurring conference call every Thursday was set up to discuss ongoing FERC issues such as the rehearing of FERC market monitoring and mitigation order, ISO governance comment opportunity, FERC staff technical conference on gas pipeline capacity into CA, FERC order requesting comments on reimposition of rate ceilings on short-term capacity releases into CA, and FERC order denying waiver of CA."

At an EPSA meeting, it was decided that there should be a single organization setting industry standards due to inherent risks in separating reliability and commercial issues. NERC was chosen as the appropriate mechanism to resolve this longstanding debate.\n\n2. Concerns were raised about NERC venturing into commercial standards, with suggestions for the GISB as an alternative forum. EPSA members agreed that continued monitoring of NERC is necessary due to its monopoly on reliability and commercial rules. They will advocate for their members' viewpoints within the independent board members and provide market perspectives.\n\n3. Michael Gildea from Duke Energy requested a conference call with Charles Yeung and Lydia (presumably other team members) to align on a common position regarding an unspecified issue ahead of a meeting in Tampa. Additionally, he expressed concerns about current reliability legislation that empowers NERC too much, potentially slowing market development.\n\n4. Changes in committee representation and participation are recommended as part of the Goulding Task Force's recommendations to provide formal representation and voting roles for Independent System Operators (ISO) / Regional Transmission Organizations (RTO) until a new model can be finalized.\n\n5. A call was made for improved communication regarding NERC issues affecting markets, with some members proposing an email/members-only bulletin board. Reliant expressed concern about allowing NERC to set commercial standards, suggesting that these should be left to RTOs due to inefficiencies.\n\n6. In a separate thread, EPSA discussed the continued involvement of their staff and members at NERC, emphasizing the need for better communication regarding NERC issues affecting markets. The group will focus on representing member viewpoints to the independent board members and advocating for RTOs to set commercial standards instead of NERC.\n\n7. Regarding pipeline capacity recall NOPR, EPSA advised that Becky will inform them during their call the next day that the team is supportive of the NOPR and will file accordingly, emphasizing caution to avoid disrupting the NOPR. The team holds a different position than EPSA, aligning with ENA's comments favoring the NOPR but subject to pipeline operational concerns. EPSA's comments include Dynegy's stance against the NOPR, and the deadline for filing is November 19th."
