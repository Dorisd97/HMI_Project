        "Subject": "ALERT:  As discussed yesterday, Davis publicly demands nearly $9",
        "Body": "billion for electricity overcharges...\n\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) California Gov. Gray Davis demanded that power\ngenerators refund nearly $9 billion in electricity overcharges and\ncomplained that federal regulators have ``looked the other way\nwhile energy companies bilked our state.''\nDavis told a Senate hearing Wednesday that the decision by the\nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission to curtail price spikes in\nCalifornia and 10 other Western states was a step forward.\nBut its actions do nothing about the overcharges'' over the\npast year, he said.\nThe governor, a Democrat, has been criticized by Republicans,\nwho charge he has allowed the California power crisis to get out of\nhand.\nDavis defended his actions, saying the state has stepped up\napproval for new power plants and strengthened conservation\nprograms. He also said the state has little control over price\ngouging by out-of-state power generators.\nThe governor once said he could solve California's problems in\n15 minutes. ... But it appears that California has continued to try\nand hide the true cost of power by having the state pay for it\ninstead of the utilities,'' putting California taxpayers in\njeopardy, said Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska.\nMurkowski said many of the alleged overcharges are by public\npower entities not under FERC jurisdiction\nSen. Joe Lieberman, D-Conn., chairman of the Governmental\nAffairs Committee, said the FERC, which regulates wholesale\nelectricity sales, has been slow to respond and ``surprisingly\nreluctant'' to assure that electricity prices are just and\nreasonable, as required by the 1934 Federal Power Act.\nThe agency's response to the Western power problem ``raises\nserious questions about whether (FERC) has or will oversee the\nnewly deregulated energy markets'' not only in the West but across\nthe rest of the country.\nThe federal agency, whose commissioners were to testify later in\nthe day, imposed limited, market-based price caps on Monday in\nCalifornia and 10 other Western states from Washington to Arizona.\nThe agency also ordered the parties to attend a conference next\nweek to try to work out agreements on overcharges and other issues.\nMonths ago, the FERC singled out $124 million in alleged\novercharges by power generators. The power companies have since\nchallenged the agency's findings and the matter remains in dispute.\nTo date not a single penny in refunds has been returned to\nCalifornia,'' complained Davis. He said that between May 2000 and\nthe beginning of this month power generators are believed to have\novercharged California $8.9 billion.\nThey must be required to give us back our money,'' said Davis.\nIt is unconscionable that FERC looked the other way while energy\ncompanies bilked our state for up to $9 billion.''\nThe state spent $7 billion for electricity in 1999 and $27\nbillion in 2000 and is projected to pay nearly $50 billion this\nyear, said Davis.\nPower generators have been able to exert extreme power over\nour energy market,'' he said.\nDavis rejected Republican criticism that the state is not\naddressing the problem. He said newly approved power plants will\nprovide 20,000 additional megawatts of electricity by 2003,\nincluding 4,000 megawatts by the end of this summer.\nEverything that can be done to bring reliable, affordable\nenergy to California is being done ... except wholesale price\nrelief,'' he said.\nThis administration has minimized this crisis (for) more\nmonths,'' said Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., alluding to President\nBush's repeated refusal to urge the FERC to mitigate electricity\nprices. Bush has strongly opposed price controls, although he\nindicated support for FERC's limited price mitigation effort this\nweek.\nMurray said the government should issue a disaster declaration\nso that businesses can get low-income loans, and require that FERC\npress its investigation into price gouging and demand refunds not\nonly in California but in the Pacific Northwest, where electricity\nprices have also skyrocketed.\nRepublicans continued their opposition to more stringent price\ncaps based on the cost of generation at individual power plants.\nHaving a federal agency try to determine what is a just and\nreasonable price is laughable,'' said Sen. Fred Thompson of\nTennessee, the committee's ranking Republican. Hard price caps\ndon't work when supply is the problem. ... They make a bad\nsituation worse,'' he said.\nAfter FERC issued its limited price control order this week,\nSenate Democrats on Tuesday said they would drop legislation to\nrequire more stringent cost-based price caps on Western electricity\nsales.\nDemocrats in the House, however, said they would continue to\npursue a bill requiring the FERC to take more aggressive action."

    "Body": "Borderline\nNo.  2001-22\nOctober 30, 2001<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = \"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office\" />\n\n\nNovember 1 Tariff Change\n\nTariff revisions detailing and addressing the use of an Operational Flow Order (OFO) on Northern Border, which were part of Northern Border's approved Park and Loan (PAL) filing, will become effective on November 1. Here is a brief overview of the upcoming changes.\n\n\nPurpose of an OFO\n\nAn OFO will be used by Northern Border to 1) alleviate conditions that threaten the integrity of the system, 2) maintain pipeline operations at pressures required to provide efficient and reliable transportation service, 3) assure adequate system line pack, and 4) maintain service for all of Northern Border's firm shippers. \n\nAn OFO will be treated as a tool of last resort.  Northern Border will first attempt to utilize its system, its services (transportation and PAL), and if necessary, assistance of interconnecting systems to alleviate operational problems before invoking its OFO tariff provisions.\n\n\nPosting of an OFO Watch\n\nIf resolution of an operational problem is unlikely, such as when a daily or cumulative OBA imbalance with an interconnected party is outside of a defined tolerance range, Northern Border will post an OFO watch.  Similar to a severe weather notice, the purpose of an OFO watch is to pre-alert shippers and interconnecting systems to a location or area on Northern Border's system in which underlying operational conditions could prompt the issuance of an OFO.\n\n\nOFO Issuance\n\nNorthern Border will issue an OFO if it is determined that an OFO watch has failed to serve as a catalyst for corrective action. \n\nA Northern Border OFO will be as localized as is reasonably possible.  Furthermore, each OFO will be tailored to match the severity of the known or anticipated problem being addressed.\n\n\nOFO Impact\n\nAn OFO can result in either the curtailment of interruptible services and/or the forced balancing of nominations and actual flows through the confirmation process. \n\nIf service is reduced or interrupted due to an OFO, Northern Border will directly provide affected shippers, as soon as possible, a summary of the service interruption that will include the operational variables that prompted such action.  In addition, affected shippers will be notified of any imbalances that require immediate resolution.\n\nRoutine status updates will be posted throughout the period in which the OFO is in effect.\n\n\nFailure to Comply\n\nWhen an OFO is issued, it is the responsibility of the affected shippers to make a good faith effort to comply.  If such shippers fail to respond to the OFO, or their response is insufficient to correct the problem, Northern Border may take further action including the curtailment of firm service or the immediate cash out of cumulative imbalances that are in excess of 10% of the Historical Flow Quantity.\n\nNorthern Border will not be liable for any costs incurred by a shipper in complying with or be exposed to any damages that result from an interruption in service due to an OFO.\n\n\nImpact of OFO Tariff Changes on Interconnects\n\nFERC Order No. 637 requires that pipelines \"take all reasonable actions to minimize the issuance and adverse impact of Operational Flow Orders (OFOs).\"  Northern Border recognizes that maintaining daily and cumulative OBA imbalances with its interconnected parties within reasonable tolerances levels is critical in meeting such obligation across the grid.  Consequently, the November 1 tariff changes includes language which define what is an acceptable tolerance range on a Northern Border OBA imbalance.\n\nTo serve as a benchmark, Northern Border has already begun calculating a Historical Flow Quantity (HFQ) for each point of interconnection on Northern Border's system.  The HFQ is the lesser of the average daily scheduled quantity for the previous 15 consecutive Gas Days or the actual daily flow quantity for such time period. \n\nOn November 1, the default cumulative OBA imbalance tolerance level for a given interconnect on Northern Border's system will be +/- 10% of the point's HFQ. If such approach fails to meet the needs of an interconnected party, Northern Border's tariff does permit the use of an alternative tolerance level at a given point of interconnect as long as it has been mutually agreed to both OBA parties.\n\nFurthermore, the daily OBA swings at interconnects on Northern Border that are on pressure control will also be monitored more closely; the default daily OBA imbalance tolerance level will be +/- 5% of the daily scheduled quantity.  Once again, Northern Border's tariff does permit deviation from this \"standardized\" daily tolerance if an alternative method is mutually acceptable to the OBA parties. \n\nFor those who would like to initiate discussions on establishing OBA imbalance tolerance levels with Northern Border that deviate from the defaults described above, please contact Scott Coburn at (402) 398.7760.",

Enron et al were concerned that the RTO initiatives underway \nwere independently developing RTOs with little emphasis on coordination with \nneighboring business practices.  \n\nAt the May 30, 2001 FERC meeting, Chairman Hebert announced this FERC \ntechnical conference may be scheduled as early as June.  This is a reversal \nof the Chairman's earlier resistance to holding a technical conference when \nhe instead favored the RTO filing process to individually address \ninterregional coordination.\n\nThe key to the Chairman's change in direction can be attributed to Enron's \nactive participation on the Electronic Scheduling Collaborative (ESC) a \nnon-NERC industry collaborative effort formed to respond to the FERC ANOPR on \nOASIS Phase II.  \n\nBy working through a EPSA/ELCON joint filing in response to the ESC filing, \nEnron was able to raise awareness of the seams coordination threats to OASIS \nPhase II development and successfully sway the ESC to file in support of the \nearlier EPSA/ELCON/Enron/Reliant/Dynegy Request for Technical Conference. \n\nGovt Affairs will continue to monitor the development of the Technical \nConference and provide needed support to resolve inter-RTO seams issues.\n\nCharles Yeung\nGovt Affairs NA\n713-853-0348",

Items of \ninterest:\n\nThird party studies may be used upon mutual agreement between SPP and \nCustomer; however, SPP is not required to allow a third party contractor in \nany instance that it cannot meet the time frames for study completion.\nThe current queued customer will bear the costs of completing a new study if \nsomeone in the queue before it withdraws.  (Dynegy asked that the withdrawing \ncustomer should pay for any new studies required by others.)\nWhile SPP is required to provide notice if the study will take more than 60 \ndays, it is not bound to complete a study in 60 days (if more time is \nreasonably needed.)\nIf transmission is not purchased, the customer is responsible for the costs \nof upgrades that are needed \"but for\" the interconnection.  However, once \ntransmission is requested, SPP is limited to charging the higher of (i) the \nnetwork upgrade expansion cost or (ii) an embedded cost rate which has the \nexpansion cost rolled-in.  This is similar to pricing on pipelines.  \nTypically, Enron would not want to pay for network upgrades (as opposed to \nthe interconnection alone costs) without obtaining the transmission right on \nOASIS.  This order does advance the argument that network upgrades which \nbenefit the system (other customers) should be paid for in rates to all \ncustomers.\n\nLet me know if you would like a copy of the order."

    "Body": "Today, we announced plans to merge with Dynegy, a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties.  Dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own.  We believe merging with Dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you've worked so hard to build.  Following are the major components of the transaction.\n\nDeal Terms\n\nThe transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of 0.2685 Dynegy shares for every Enron share.  For example, each 1,000 shares of Enron stock will be converted to 268 shares of Dynegy upon closing, plus cash for fractional shares, upon closing.\nChevronTexaco owns approximately 26 percent of Dynegy's outstanding common stock.  ChevronTexaco will invest $1.5 billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional $1 billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger.  Dynegy will immediately invest $1.5 billion in cash in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas.\nTotal outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares.\nThe transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close late next year.\n\nEnron will have immediate access to Dynegy's $1.5 billion cash investment in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary.\n\nManagement of Newly Formed Company\n\nChuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company, which will be called Dynegy Inc., and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO.\n\nI will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes.  I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Greg Whalley will continue to serve as president and COO of Enron until the transaction closes.  Then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Mark Frevert will continue as vice chairman of Enron.\n\nManagement from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth, efficient integration.  The make-up of the integration team has not yet been determined.\n\nThe merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2002.  This merger will create an enormous growth engine, providing great opportunities for our employees, shareholders and customers.  As with any merger, some elimination of positions is almost inevitable, and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company.  We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions.  Clearly, we cannot rule out involuntary separation, but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations.  I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible.\n\nAs I said in my video, this is a day like no other in our company's history.  We considered several options, but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses.\n\nI know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps.  We have a list of frequently asked questions posted at <http://home.enron.com/updates/>.  If you have additional questions, please submit them to questions@enron.com <mailto:questions@enron.com>.  We will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions.  If you receive any calls from the media, please refer them to our media team at (713) 853-5670.\n\nI ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company.  Rather than closing doors, we are opening new ones, as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise, including our market reach, financial strength and industry experience.  Together, we will be a new merchant powerhouse.\n\nAnd again, thank you for everything you have done for Enron.\n\n\nInvestors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint proxy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes available, because it will contain important information.  Investors and security holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospectus (when it is available) and other documents containing information about Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov.  Copies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus and the SEC filings that will be incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement/prospectus may also be obtained for free by directing a request to either:  Investor Relations, Dynegy Inc., 1000 Louisiana, Suite 5800, Houston, TX 77002, Phone:  (713) 507-6400, Fax:  (713) 507-6808; or Investor Relations, Enron Corp., 1400 Smith Street, Houston, TX 77002, Phone:  (713) 853-3956, Fax:  (713) 646-3002.\n\nIn addition, the identity of the persons who, under SEC rules, may be considered \"participants in the solicitation\" of Dynegy and Enron shareholders in connection with the proposed transactions, and any description of their direct or indirect interests, by security holdings or otherwise, are available in an SEC filing under Schedule 14A made by each of Dynegy and Enron.",

    "Body": "Several thoughts from federal reg./transmission side:\nI haven't worked with a VEPCO interconnection agreement yet, but many times \nthere are requirements that the generator is required to provide emergency \npower to the interconnected transmission provider, in which case you would \nwant the interconnection agreement to cover all costs you would incur to \nreplace the energy at a different location (usually it is difficult to get \nthis agreement, so you should check and then factor that into the equation).  \nI would be happy to look at the interconnection agreement with you.\nInterconnection of generation is a separate process from requesting \ntransmission.  It appears that VEPCO has to buy the transmission (or use its \nnetwork transmission) when the Delivery Point is the plant.  Enron will have \nto purchase transmission on VEPCO if it is selling to third parties off the \nplant and will have to purchase transmission on other systems if it wants to \nsupply at an alternate delivery point.  Please discuss this with Kevin \nPresto's tranmission people (Bill Rust on 31).  Enron cannot use VEPCO's \nnetwork transmission to delivery to third parties.\nIs this plant in the VEPCO queue yet?  Also, FERC has issued some recent \nrulings that deal with time limits on system impact studies, etc.  While \nVEPCO is probably incentivized to get this built, you want to make sure that \nyou do not lose optionality in selling to third parties from the plant due to \ntransmission constraints.  A request for transmission on OASIS is the only \nway to ensure deliverability to third parties.\n3.5 (c) Intra-day scheduling--You may have hourly transmission risk for an \nincrease.  Unless you buy longer term firm, you will deliver from other \nsources using hourly non-firm, which is the lowest priority of transmission \nand subject to getting cut.  You may want to consider doing this on \nbest/reasonable efforts basis.  (Also, even if you purchase \ndaily/monthly/yearly firm to serve third parties, if you change the point of \nreceipt or point of delivery temporarily, your request is treated as \nnon-firm.)\n12.4--Currently VEPCO is interested in joining the Alliance ISO (an RTO that \nhas not been approved by FERC yet--competing ISO to Midwest ISO), but since \nFERC has not approved any RTO for VEPCO yet, there could be significant \nchanges in the transmission charges/methods of obtaining \ntransmission/grandfathering of current transmission, etc during this \ncontract.  Make sure with the ENA attorneys that this out/increase in price \ncovers that circumstance.\nUnderlying tranmission rates on VEPCO or any other provider can change at \nmost any time, subject to the provider filing a rate case.  Therefore, any \ncurrent transmission rates shown on OASIS are not necessarily what you will \npay over the term of any transmission that Enron may purchase to serve this \ncontract.  Generally, transmission providers will not agree to fixed rates.\n\n\nTom Chapman\n06/13/2000 06:07 PM",

        "Body": "Christi--\n\nThis is the note that I received on Tuesday June 13.  This is a relatively \nearly draft of the PPA.\n\nI think that we still have to purchase the land associated with the sites and \ndo the due diligence on the site with regards to some of the siting issues.  \nIN addition, in NC we are going to get a CPCN to site the plant to speed up \nthe regulatory process in the NCUC.  I think that this will make the issue \nless contentious because of the NCUC's acceptance of the Dynegy plant at \nRockingham that had a PPA with Duke Power.  \n\nUsing the Dynegy plant as a guideline, their only stumbling block was their \ngas agreeement.  They built a bypass off Transco.  We would be taking gas \nfrom the LDC of Rocky Mount.  Having talked with the regulatory folks at the \nNCUC who handle gas issues, this is the preferred route.  So, I do not think \nthat we have any major state issues.  I think that right now we are simply \nworking on some of the siting issues.\n\nThat being said, I will let you take a look at the PPA and let me know or \nJeff Keenan (or even Heather Kroll or Ozzie Pagan) if you think that there \nare some transmission issues or other issues on the federal level.  \n\nThanks.\n\nTom\nForwarded by Tom Chapman/HOU/ECT on 06/13/2000 06:04 \n\n\nLinda J Simmons\n06/13/2000 08:45 AM"

        "Body": "Lisa:  Attached is a draft of the Power Purchase Agreement with VEPCO, based \non the current version of the term sheet.  In preparing the draft, we did \nencounter several additional questions for Enron's consideration.  These are \nnoted with brackets and, in some cases, italicized notes, in the draft and \nare also highlighted below.  You may want to address these issues before this \ngoes to VEPCO.\n\nCover and first page-- Should the party to the agreement (for the moment) be \nENA or a special purpose company?\n\nDefinitions--  We included a defined term \"Emergency Start-Up\" (a start up or \nincrease in energy scheduled during a day) and a place in Exhibit A to \ninclude a price for this, although this was not covered in the term sheet.\n\nSection 2.2--  We included a provision for VEPCO to take test energy (energy \ncharge only; no demand charge)--do you want this?\n\nSection 2.3--  This was taken from the term sheet, but is it correct that COD \nwill be July 1 (since the demand charge is supposed to start June 1?)  Also, \nit would be best to define \"commencement of construction\" to avoid \ncontroversy down the road.  We could either do this now or put in a \nplaceholder that indicates it needs to be defined or be silent, whichever is \nyour preference.  Also, bear in mind that we have not included a specific \nremedy (e.g., liquidated damages) if the Seller does not achieve that \nmilestone on time.  Under the default provision (Section 8.1(c)), there would \nbe a 30 day period to cure before Buyer could terminate (extendible to 90 \ndays if a longer period of time is needed and Seller diligently pursues the \ncure).  Would you prefer the right to pay ld's and extend the time period?\n\nSection 3.1(b)--  Should the 1400 hour limitation apply to all sales under \nthis PPA or only sales from the Facility?  I.e., would you use this Agreement \nto sell to VEPCO power in addition to what would be available from the \nFacility?  Also, is this a calendar year limitation--i.e., could they take \n1400 hours in the period June-Dec. 2001 or does the 1400 hours need to be \npro-rated for the first year?\n\nSection 3.4-- Since this is not a base load plant, the normal definition of \nAvailability as the number of hours in a year of operations compared to the \ntotal hours in the year would not seem to be applicable.  Instead, we stated \nthat the Facility would be capable of being available 92% of the year (other \nthan due to Force Majeure and 336 hours (2 weeks) of scheduled \nmaintenance)--i.e., that if they tried to schedule it, it is expected to be \navailable.  Is that what Enron intended?  Additionally, the term sheet stated \nthat a remedy for failure to meet Availability would need to be agreed--why \nwouldn't cost of cover damages be appropriate? Also, please note that we \nincluded language stating that Seller will not perform maintenance during \npeak periods.\n\nSection 3.5(b)-- Please note the bracketed language re taking Blocks of \nEnergy.  We have 50 MW minimum blocks but the capacity is 223--should we \nallow the last Block to be 23 if they've scheduled all the rest?\n\nSection 3.5(c)-- Please see the bracketed language at the end of this Section.\n\nSection 4.7-- Should there a required minimum take of Energy?\n\nArticle 6-- The Genco/Santee Cooper form of PPA we used as a model did not \nhave any provisions on metering.  (See placeholder note in Article 6.)  Do \nyou want to add such a provision, ignore it or just include a placeholder for \nnow?\n\nSection 9.1-- Is 30 days from invoice correct for the payment due date or \nwould you prefer a shorter period?\n\nArticle 15-- The Genco/Santee Cooper form had mediation as a required step \nprior to arbitration.  Should we keep that?  Also, the form of arbitration is \nbaseball\" arbitration--i.e.,  the arbitrators have to chose one party's \nposition or the other's.  Is that what you want?\n\nSection 16.2--  We used New York for governing law, on the premise that it \nwill be difficult to get VEPCO to agree to Texas law and we would not \nrecommend Virginia law for this contract.\n\nExhibit A-- There are a number of questions on the pricing exhibit--please \nsee the bracketed notes therein.\n\nPlease call and let us know how you would like to proceed on this draft.\n\nVEPPPA.DOC"

    "Body": "Dear Generation/Power Marketing Executive:\n\nThe following is this week's Alliance Express newsletter, and a special \nannouncement regarding a proposed action by the Financial Accounting \nStandards Board (FASB).\n\nFASB 133\nFASB is considering an exception to Statement of Financial Accounting \nStandards (SFAS) No. 133 that will exempt energy companies from the \nrequirement to account for capacity contracts as derivatives.  A vote against \nthe exception would result in a significant increase in earnings volatility, \nand raises other important concerns for energy suppliers.  (Attached is a \nsummary of this issue.)  The Board is expected to vote on this issue during \nMay 2001.  EEI will be taking steps to appraise FASB of our concerns.  If \nyou, or company CFO would like more information about this effort, please \ncontact Richard McMahon, Executive Director of the Alliance of Energy \nSuppliers, at rmcmahon@eei.org, or at 202-508-5571.\n\n\nAlliance of Energy Suppliers Express=02=05April 25, \n2001\nINSIDE WASHINGTON\n\nFEDERAL AFFAIRS\n\nBill Repealing PUHCA Is Approved By Senate Committee***\nThe Senate Banking Committee today approved S 206, a bill that repeals the \nPublic Utility Holding Company Act of 1935.  The bill would repeal PUHCA and \ntransfer oversight of public utility holding companies from the Securities \nand Exchange Commission to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and \nappropriate state agencies.\nS.206 was approved with two amendments.  Offered by Sen. Mike Enzi (R-WY), \nthe first amendment would establish the Electric Energy Market Competition \nTask Force to study competition in the wholesale and retail market for \nelectric energy in the United States. The task force would be made up of \nrepresentatives of FERC, the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade \nCommission, as well as non-voting representatives from the Department of \nAgriculture and the Securities and Exchange Commission. The amendment also \ncontained a provision, co-sponsored by Sen. Paul Sarbanes (D-MD), that would \npreserve FERC's authority to require that energy rates are reasonable and do \nnot include the pass-through of holding company costs that are unrelated to \nenergy.\nAnother amendment, offered by Sen. Jon Corzine (D-NJ), initiated a study by \nthe General Accounting Office of the success of federal and state governments \nin preventing anticompetitive practices by public utility holding companies \nand in promoting competition and efficient energy markets.\n\nInstitute=02=07s Tax Agreement With Public Power Again Introduced on Hill***\n\nThe tax agreement EEI reached with the American Public Power Association \nAPPA) and the Large Public Power Council (LPPC) again has been introduced in \nthe House.  The bill (HR 1459) contains the same provisions as were in a \nmeasure (HR 4971), with technical corrections, introduced during the 106th \nCongress.  HR 1459 was introduced by Rep. J.D. Hayworth (R-AZ) and nine \noriginal co-sponsors from the Ways and Means Committee.\n\nHR 1459 contains four key provisions with tax code changes:  1) The tax-free \nsale or spin-off of transmission assets into an RTO is allowed, 2) Nuclear \ndecommissioning laws are adapted to a competitive market by allowing \ndeductions to a trust fund no longer subject to cost-of service ratemaking, \n3) The contributions in aid of construction (CIAC) tax on interconnections to \ntransmission and distribution facilities is eliminated, and 4) Private use \ntax rules are changed to permit open access to transmission and distribution \nfacilities.\n\nThe measure was referred to the House Ways and Means Committee, and EEI has \nurged Congress to act without delay in moving it forward.  Enactment will \nhelp encourage a vigorous but fair competitive environment, the Institute \nnoted.  The same legislation has been incorporated into S 389, Senate Energy \nCommittee Chairman Frank Murkowski's (R-AK) energy security bill, and \nstand-alone legislation could also be introduced.  Hearings are expected to \nbe held in both the Senate Finance and House Ways and Means Committees, \nprobably after consideration of President Bush's individual tax proposal.\n\nADMINISTRATION/FERC\n\nWhite House Seeks $2 Trillion Budget In Fiscal Year 2002***\n\nPresident Bush last week transmitted a $2 trillion fiscal year 2002 budget \nrequest to Capitol Hill.  The Administration noted that its proposal \nmoderates recent explosive growth in discretionary spending to four percent \nin 2002,* an increase of $26 billion over the preceding fiscal year.  The \nbudget bid contains a $231 billion total surplus in 2002, and projects a $5.6 \ntrillion surplus over the next ten years.\n\nIn the energy area, the Administration noted the federal government=02=07s \nlongstanding and evolving role* in the sector, pointing out that most \nfederal energy programs and agencies have no state or private counterparts.  \nIt proposed about $2.8 billion in discretionary spending for energy programs, \nand about $2.1 billion in tax benefits, *mainly to encourage development of \ntraditional and alternative energy sources.*  DOE=02=07s budget request was $19.2 \nbillion, including $2.3 billion for energy resources programs.  This later \nfigure represents a decrease of $196 million, or 7.9 percent, from fiscal \nyear 2001.\n\nIn the environmental sector, the Administration sought some $7.3 billion in \ndiscretionary funding for EPA, including a $3.7 billion operating program \nfocused on implementation of most federal pollution control laws.\n\nSuccess of Restructuring Tied to Energy Strategy, FERC=02=07s Massey Asserts***\n\nElectric restructuring may be in jeopardy, and its success *is in the hands \nof regulators and policymakers,* FERC Commissioner William Massey has \nasserted.  Speaking at a recent National Governors Association policy forum \nin Philadelphia, Commissioner Massey urged officials to pay attention to the \nkey elements of a national energy strategy.\n\nFirst, he specified, there is a need for an adequate supply of the energy \ncommodity.  Turning to a second element, Commissioner Massey told forum \nattendees that *all the supply in the world won=02=07t help unless it can be \ndelivered over an adequate, efficient, non-discriminatory network.*  \nCommissioner Massey identified market structure as the third essential \nelement of a national energy strategy, while citing an inherent difficulty: \nthat *good structure cannot be easily parsed between wholesale and retail \njurisdictions.*  Accordingly, he said, FERC and the states must work together \non market structure.\n\nThe final element of a successful energy strategy, the commissioner \nspecified, is the need for aggressive FERC intervention when markets fail to \ndo their job.  *If the states cannot depend on the wholesale market regulator \nto ensure reasonable prices for consumers,* he cautioned, they *will surely \nthink twice before heading down the restructuring path.*\n\nNEW GENERATION\n\nDynegy To Build Second Plant in Kentucky***\n\nDynegy has announced plans to construct a new 330 megawatt plant adjacent to \nthe Riverside Generating project in Lawrence County, Kentucky.  Dynegy will \nsell the power generated at the plant in the wholesale market.  Commercial \noperation is expected to begin first quarter of 2002.\n\nPPL To Expand Generation Capacity***\n\nPPL Corporation this week said it would build a 540 megawatt power plant near \nChicago and would increase the capacity of its Susquehanna nuclear plant by \n100 megawatts.  CEO William Hecht said the Illinois plant is expected to be \nin service by the summer of 2002.\n\nConstellation Energy Group Announces Eight New Plants***\n\nConstellation Energy Group  this week announced that the company is scheduled \nto bring four peaking power plants on line this summer.  Additionally, four \nlarger power plants are scheduled to enter service in the following two \nsummers. The four peaking plants are located in Illinois, Pennsylvania, \nVirginia and West Virginia.  The larger power plants are under construction \nin California, Florida, Illinois, and Texas.\n\nWe=02=07re building in these seven states because they serve regions where \nwholesale electricity is needed and where we can provide energy to support \nour national power marketing business,* said Constellation Energy Group \nChairman and CEO Christian Poindexter.\n\nCalifornia Energy Commission Approves Construction of Otay Mesa Generating \nPlant***\n\nPG&E Corporation=02=07s National Energy Group (NEG) last week announced that the \nCalifornia Energy Commission (CEC) has approved construction of the Otay Mesa \nGenerating Plant in San Diego County, which the NEG has developed.  The 500 \nmegawatt project will produce enough electricity to power about 1,000 homes.  \nAfter the development process is completed, Calpine Corporation will assume \nownership of the project and will construct and operate the plant.  NEG will \ncontract for up to half the plants output.\n\nENERGY DATA\n\nWeekly Electric Output (Week 15)***\n\nElectric output reached 63,528 GWh for the week ending April 14 (Week 15), \nwith the highest increase over 2000 levels in the South Central states, which \nboth had a 12.6 percent increase over 2000 for week 15.  Year-to-date, the \nRocky Mountain region experienced the greatest increase in output (7.6 \npercent) over 2000.

    "Body": "Gas OII Parties\n\nPer our discussion at the April 10 meeting to discuss draft tariffs to\nimplement the PG&E Gas OII settlement, PG&E is providing the following\nmaterials:\n\nRevised Gas OII and PG&E Tariff Preparation Schedule.  The testimony\nand hearing schedule adopted at the April 11 prehearing conference is now\nincluded, along with revised dates for the tariff approval process for\nPG&E's settlement.  Please remember that much of this schedule is\nspeculative - and highly dependent on the actual timing of Commission\nactions and presumes we can achieve broad consensus on tariff language. For\nPG&E's settlement tariffs, we have delayed our providing a next draft until\nMay 25.  We need the extra time to address the issues raised at the April 10\nmeeting, and to further explore our internal process requirements.  We\ntherefore delayed our next tariff meeting until June 27, which should be\nafter hearings and opening briefs on SoCal matters.  If the litigation\nschedule changes, we may need to revisit our tariff preparation schedule.\n\nList of Issues.  This list is compiled from the April 10 meeting,\nplus the April 6 CPAG meeting.  As we work through these issues, we may be\ncontacting individual parties to further discuss the issue before we send\nout our next tariff draft.  Please let us know if you have comments or\nadditions to this list.\n\nExhibit A to Attachment K to the CTA Request Form, proposed CTA bill\nformat.  A draft of this proposed bill format Exhibit has been completed\nsince we sent out the last package. The attached table is for your\ninformation on the source of various elements to be included in the bill\nformat, and would not be part of the final Exhibit.  If you have questions\nor comments on this Exhibit, please include Cathy Bretz on your E-mail\nclbe@pge.com) or call her at 415-973-3140.\n\nCore Rate Impacts of CTA Storage Unbundling.  An illustration of the\nexpected rate impacts of this program was completed since we sent out the\nlast package.  This illustration was presented at the CPAG and Tariff Review\nmeetings. If you have questions or comments on this attachment, please\ninclude Jerry Miller on your E-mail (grm8@pge.com) or call him at\n415-973-4104.\n\nWe also continue to welcome comments or concerns you may have on the draft\ntariffs for our Comprehensive Gas OII Settlement.  We will try to respond to\nthem in our next draft tariff package, to be sent May 25.\n\nThanks to those parties who attended the April 10 meeting and provided\nexcellent comments and suggestions.\n\nSincerely,\n\n\nRandy Litteneker\n\n\nAttachments\n\nOII + Tariff Schedule w6.doc>> <<April 10 GasOII Wrkshp Issues_.doc>>\nEXHIBIT A of ATTACHMENT K Sample Consolidated Bill Items cb2.doc>>\nIllustrative Rates_CTA unbundling.doc>>\n\nOII + Tariff Schedule w6.doc\nApril 10 GasOII Wrkshp Issues_.doc\nEXHIBIT A of ATTACHMENT K Sample Consolidated Bill Items cb2.doc\nIllustrative Rates_CTA unbundling.doc",

        "Body": "http://www.thestreet.com/_yahoo/comment/detox/1422781.html\n\nWhy One Firm Thinks Enron Is Running Out of Gas By Peter Eavis Senior Columnist Originally posted at 5:23 PM ET 5/9/01 on RealMoney.com A small research boutique with a reputation for rigorous analysis is telling clients to quickly dump Enron (ENE :NYSE - news ), believing that the energy trading giant's 2001 earnings will fall well short of Wall Street's forecasts.  Cambridge, Mass.-based Off Wall Street, led by analyst Mark Roberts, thinks Enron's 2001 earnings will fall 6 cents short of the consensus estimate of $1.79. The firm also believes Enron stock should trade around $30, nearly 50% below Wednesday's $59.20.  The firm's 26-page report, published May 6, highlights Enron's declining profitability and increasing leverage and suggests that the company should trade on the same sort of multiple as a trading firm like Goldman Sachs (GS :NYSE - news ), which has a 2001 price-to-earnings ratio about half of Enron's 33 times. OWS also alleges that Enron's earnings quality is poor and that key parts of its financial statements are confusing and opaque.  Houston-based Enron didn't comment by publication time on elements of the report that Detox  sent the company. An energy analyst who is bullish on Enron's outlook says the OWS report contains fundamental misunderstandings about the energy market and Enron's business model, but he says the report does include some ground-breaking and valid insights. (The analyst's firm doesn't give stock recommendations.)  Economies of Scale Why care what Off Wall Street writes, compared with, say, analysts at Merrill Lynch (MER :NYSE - news )? For one, OWS has an excellent track record. Particularly sweet was 2000, when the tech stocks it had bashed came crashing down. It has also shown itself to be well ahead of the curve, recommending that clients sell e-tailer priceline.com (PCLN :Nasdaq - news ) in June 1999, when faith in Internet stocks was at its blindest and their prices at their most insane. Pulling Back Enron retreats after long rally Enron, with its domination of a burgeoning energy market, annual revenue of over $100 billion and impressive earnings growth, can hardly be ranked alongside the likes of priceline. But OWS thinks Enron is set for a precipitous drop nonetheless. Why?  OWS's main beef is that key profitability measures are in decline. Margins on Enron's pretax operating earnings (which the company's earnings releases call IBIT, or income before interest, taxes and other items) are falling. Total IBIT of $795 million in the first quarter amounted to only 1.59% of the $50 billion in revenue for the period, compared with a 2.08% margin in the fourth quarter and 4.75% in the year-earlier period. Revenue in the first quarter was nearly quadrupled from the year-earlier period, yet IBIT rose only 27%. This shrinkage is due to lower-margin trading income making up an increasingly large share of Enron's revenue base.  OWS thus calculates that for the remainder of 2001 Enron needs to generate an extra $2.1 billion in revenue for each additional penny it makes over its 2000 EPS of $1.47 to reach analysts' expectation of $1.79.  The energy analyst counters that OWS apparently hasn't grasped how Enron can continue to increase earnings even when margins shrink. It does so simply by increasing volumes as the energy market balloons in size. In other words, margins may decline, but since revenues are so much higher, earnings still go up. Illustrating this, first-quarter 2001 EPS of 49 cents was 23% ahead of the year-ago figure, even though the IBIT margin shrank by 3.2 percentage points. The analyst thinks Enron will make $1.82 per share in 2001.  Growing On You In addition, the huge growth in the energy market that has so helped Enron is likely to continue for several years, according to the analyst. He notes that roughly 75% of the electricity available in the U.S. still isn't traded in a market. \"Eventually it will be part of a competitive environment, but it'll take five to 10 years,\" says the analyst. And he believes the extreme volatility in energy-related commodities that has also benefited Enron will exist for longer than OWS projects.  Still, OWS's point on profitability is bolstered by other profit measures. Return on capital (net income as a percentage of equity plus debt) was 6.6% in 2000, down on 1999's 6.9% and well below the 2000 returns on capital at Duke (DUK :NYSE - news ) (11.8%), Dynegy (DYN :NYSE - news ) (12.1%) and even Goldman (8.9%).  Even Enron bulls will admit that its financials are hard to follow. For example, it doesn't give a gross margin number for its wholesale services, or trading, business, which accounts for 96% of revenue. But one area of the company's financial statements registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission that consistently bugs analysts is the part that describes Enron's related party transactions, which are the deals it does with entities that have some sort of link to the firm. In fact, one of the related entities that Enron has traded with is headed by Enron's CFO, Andrew Fastow. The energy analyst comments: \"Why are they doing this? It's just inappropriate.\"  The reason for maintaining these hard-to-follow related party deals has been a source of speculation. But OWS analysis shows how a sales of optical fiber to a related party may have been used to goose earnings in the second quarter of 2000. Estimated profits from the so-called dark fiber (optical cable without the gear to send data over it) transaction allowed Enron to beat analysts' second-earnings earnings estimate by 2 cents a share, rather than missing by 2 cents.  How soon before Wall Street follows Off Wall Street on Enron?"

    "Body": "Dear Potential Gas Supplier\n\nAs some of you may know our authority to buy gas off our existing spot agreement\nwill come to an end on December 31, 2001.  While we will honor current\ncommitments for gas to be delivered after that date, but we will not be able to\nuse the spot agreement to buy any more gas.  The reason that this is happening\nis that our City Attorney has interpreted the new City Charter as not allowing\ndelegations of authority such as employed in the way we buy gas now.\n\nWe are seeking approval for an ordinance which must be approved by the City\nCouncil that will restore our former ability to buy gas with the kind of\nagreement most gas suppliers are familiar.  We have the ordinance approved by\nthe City Attorney and it will shortly be in the pipeline for approval by our\nBoard and the City Council, but until then, this contract is a stop gap to keep\nus operating.\n\nI've attached the new contract and a cover letter which explains what we are\ndoing.  The deadline is November 8, 2001 at 4:00 PM.  We will take the executed\ncontracts to our Board with the counterparties listed on a Board Resolution and,\nif it is approved, we will be allowed to buy gas from this group after the new\nyear begins.  This is not the ideal contract but one we feel our Board will be\ncomfortable with until we can get around the Charter problem.  I can't make any\nchanges to this contract.  There is a notice published in the LA Times about the\navailability of the contract but I am sending it to you directly as someone we\nhave already done business with (and undoubtedly have satisfied all our\nboilerplate requirements) and will probably be interested in what we are trying\nto do here.\n\nI Hope most of you will respond.

    "Body": "Today we released additional information about our related party and off-balance sheet transactions.  We have made this information available both on our website and in a Form 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nThe information provides further details about:\n\nthe $1.2 billion charge to shareholders' equity announced in the third quarter and the transactions related to that charge;\na restatement of prior years' financial statements to reflect this reduction in shareholders' equity, the consolidation of three entities and prior year proposed audit adjustments and reclassifications;\nthe Special Committee appointed by the Enron Board of Directors to review transactions between Enron and related parties; \nthe LJM limited partnerships, including a discussion of transactions between Enron and LJM entities; and\ntransactions between Enron and other Enron employees.\n\nThis information addresses a number of concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the SEC.  As our Board's new Special Committee continues its review of various matters, we will continue to cooperate fully with the SEC in its investigation, and we will continue to respond to investor requests so that they can evaluate, appreciate and appropriately value the strength of our core businesses.  \n\nRestatement of Earnings\n\nBased on information that we have recently obtained, Enron and its auditors determined that certain off-balance sheet entities should have been included in Enron's consolidated financial statements pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles.  As a result, Enron will restate its financial statements from 1997 to 2000 and for the first and second quarters of 2001.  These restatements have no material effect on Enron's current financial position.  Here are some details included in the filing:\n\nNet income for each period will be impacted by the retroactive consolidation of Joint Energy Development Investments (JEDI) and Chewco beginning in November 1997, the consolidation of an LJM1 subsidiary for 1999 and 2000 and prior year proposed audit adjustments.  Enron's current assessment indicates that the restatement will include:\n\na reduction of approximately $96 million in 1997\na reduction of approximately $113 million in 1998\na reduction of approximately $250 million in 1999 \na reduction of approximately $132 million in 2000\nan increase of approximately $17 million for the first quarter of 2001 \nan increase of approximately $5 million for the second quarter of 2001\na reduction of $17 million for the third quarter of 2001.  \n\nThe consolidation of JEDI and Chewco also will increase Enron's debt by approximately $711 million in 1997, $561 million in 1998, $685 million in 1999 and $628 million in 2000.\n\nThe restatement will have no material impact on Enron's reported earnings for the nine-month period ending September 2001.\n\nYou can obtain more detailed information on the items described above by accessing the Form 8-K filing at <http://www.enron.com/corp/sec/>.\n\nWe will continue to review our strategic, operational and financial position, and we will continue to keep you updated on any developments.",

    "Body": "Here are my notes from today's call.  As with Monday, I've focused on getting them out as quickly as possible rather than taking extra time to re-organize them by subject.\n\nEnron's business has been grouped into three buckets:  Core, Non-core, and Under Review.  \nCore:  Wholesale energy business in North America and Europe, retail energy, pipelines\nNon-core:  Broadband, water, and international assets (i.e. EGAS).  Enron has approx. $8Bn in investments in these assets, and they have produced 'dismal' returns.  Enron will be exiting these businesses and will attempt to wind them up in an orderly fashion.  An aggressive divestiture program has been set in motion for these assets.  \nUnder Review:  EGM, EIM.  These businesses are being closely examined to determine whether they have a reasonable chance of long-term viability.  Required resource levels are being carefully studied.  Following review, Enron will move the different portions of these businesses to core or non-core as the analysis dictates.  \nApproximately $800MM of asset sales are under contract and expected to close in the fourth quarter.  These include a gas LDC in Brazil, EcoElectrica, and our Indian E&P assets.  \nEnron is in active pursuit of an additional private equity infusion of $500MM-1Bn.  Given the current environment, raising equity in the public markets would be 'inefficient', McMahon says.\nShort-term liquidity is provided by the $3Bn of credit drawn upon a few weeks ago, the $1Bn of new debt, and the $1.5Bn equity infusion from Dynegy.  Longer-term, the proceeds from the sale of PGE will provide liquidity.  Asset sales over the next year will be used to pay down debt.\nMcMahon described the major off-balance-sheet vehicles:\nMarlin was set up to hold Azurix assets.  It was initially capitalized with $950MM of 144a debt and $125MM of equity (raised from Enron and institutional investors).  The debt is supported by the equity and by Azurix' assets.  Enron is obligated to cover any deficit at the time the debt becomes due on 3/17/03 (the 'Enron topup' obligation).  The 3/17/03 date is accelerated in the event that Enron is rated below-investment-grade by any one of the three major agencies.  The primary asset of Marlin is Wessex Water.  As long as Wessex is worth at least $2.6Bn, there will be no Enron topup required.  If we take a 25% haircut to present book value, Enron will have to provide $650MM in consideration upon retirement of the debt.  This $650MM would hit Enron cash, income, and equity balances.  \nOsprey contains energy-related assets and 'other assets'.  It was initially capitalized with $2.4Bn of 144a debt and $220MM in equity (ENE and institutionals).  As with Marlin, the entity is an asset-backed structure with an Enron topup guarantee. The debt is supported by a) the assets; b) $1Bn of convertible preferred ENE (convertible into 50MM shares of ENE common); and c) additional ENE common as needed for topup.  Assuming the same 25% hypothetical haircut to current book value, Enron would have to deliver approx. $600MM of topup funds--which would hit ENE cash, income, and equity.  The debt must be retired by 9/17/02, with the same cut-to-junk early trigger provision as Marlin.  \nYosemite and the Credit-Linked Notes are predominantly commodity transactions entered into with 'large financial institutions'.  The underlying transactions are already on Enron's balance sheet.  McMahon says that there is no Enron share obligation related to these instruments.\nDynegy has reviewed all of these vehicles, McMahon says.\nOur 10Q will be filed five days late.  The 10Q will include all of this detail regarding the off-balance-sheet vehicles.\nThe special committee investigation is still ongoing.  The committee meets 2-3 times/week, sometimes more often.  The outside auditors (D&T) and external counsel hired by the committee are working 'virtually 7 days a week'.  Lay estimates that it will take the committee several more weeks to complete its investigation.\nMcMahon says it's 'way too early to tell' if any asset writedowns are called for.  That analysis is underway, but it will not be complete for some time.  \nOsprey contains the European power projects (Trakya and Saarlux), some North American merchant investments, and some Brazilian assets.  \nUnder the merger agreement, Enron cannot dispose of assets representing more than 15% of the balance sheet without Dynegy approval.  However, an appendix to the agreement holds a list of assets that are specifically permitted to be sold without Dynegy approval.  \nBroadband is expected to be fully wound up 'sometime over the course of the next year'.  (Did not catch this part clearly).  \nThe ENE topup obligation for Marlin (represented by ENE common that would have to be delivered) will be converted into an obligation for an equivalent amount of DYN shares upon closing.  \n1.9Bn of debt is carried at the Azurix level.  \nCurrent book value of the Osprey assets is $2.1Bn.  \nNo Dynegy outs other than the previously discussed general MAC clause and the $3.5Bn legal liability clause.  \nYosemite and the Credit-Linked notes are functionally equivalent to ENE senior unsecured debt (this section somewhat unclear).  The underlying transactions represented volumes of 'crude oil and gas'.  The transactions relate to the 'physical movement' of these commodities.  The swaps related to Yosemite and the CLNs would be financially settled.  \nWhalley was asked about the return of trading business to normal volumes.  He said that he cannot yet give an update on the progress of customers returning to our longer-term products.  Acknowledges that a few anxious customers put long-term deals on hold last week.  Says that our first focus is on getting our short-term business back up to normal levels.  It will be 'a couple of weeks' before we're able to give an update on the comfort levels of our customers regarding long-term deals with us.  \nMcMahon:  There hasn't been a major relaxation of credit requirements by our customers--credit requirements continue to follow strict contractual provisions as called for in our individual agreements with our various customers.  But 'we have seen a return of some of the transactions, some of the flows.'\nWhalley says that we're hoping to see a return to more normal trading levels late this week or early next week.\nLay says that cost cuts will be made across of all of our businesses.  The situation gives us an opportunity to review our entire cost structure, he says.  The cuts will certainly be deeper in our non-core businesses.  Whalley then quickly interjects (some might say interrrupts) with a clarification that there are no plans to reduce the size of our North American energy trading business.  We will be looking at, perhaps, streamlining some of our processes and making prudent adjustments, but there are no plans to reduce the size of the business.\nMcMahon:  \"The company is overlevered; that's a fact.\"--hence our pursuit of additional equity.\nMcMahon mentions that business was better at the start of this week than at the end of last week.\nENE had approx. $1Bn in cash as of 9/30, which McMahon points out would be unusual for us.  \n\nAs before, give me a call at 3-3055 if you'd like more color.\n\nPatrick Tucker",

We believe it\naddresses many of the issues and concerns you have raised in the workshops.\n\n\nAs an overview, this proposal:\n\nMaintains the basic Gas Accord structure in place today for the\nperiod 2003 to 2007.\n\nOffers end user transportation rates for 2003 lower for most\ncustomers than rates in effect today.\n\nProvides for vintaged Redwood path rates for core customers.\n\nOffers a 7.5 cent/dth rate to large customers while minimizing rate\nchanges to other customers, minimizing the incentive for these customers to\nseek to bypass local transmission charges and other CPUC-approved charges.\n\nAdopts guidelines to improve reliability and help moderate prices in\ngas commodity markets, and identifies the capital projects needed to meet\nthese guidelines over the course of the GA II period (2003-2007).\n\nProvides a high degree of rate stability, with a 3.5% escalator to\ncapture both inflation and the cost of needed capital projects.  The\nguaranteed rates will be adjustable only for significant changes in the cost\nof capital or increased costs due to governmental requirements or\ncatastrophic events.\n\nPreserves a rate differential between the Redwood and Baja paths,\nalthough somewhat less than the current differential.\n\nProposes a two-stage open season for firm transportation services\nbeginning in 2003, with end users receiving a first option on available\ncapacity.\n\nMaintains the core aggregation program with some adjustments.\n\nPG&E also anticipates that the Core Procurement Incentive Mechanism (CPIM)\nwill be similar to today's mechanism, but will reflect the somewhat larger\ncapacity holdings needed to meet anticipated increases in core demand and to\nmeet a 1-day in 10-year cold weather event.\n\nThis also will serve as a reminder that an all-Party meeting is scheduled at\nPG&E's headquarters in San Francisco on January 10 and 11, to discuss this\nproposal and to respond to your questions.  We look forward to answering\nyour questions and receiving your feedback.\n\nThe attached documents include the GA II Settlement proposal, an Attachment\na copy of PG&E's proposed Gas Rule 27), and a set of supporting workpapers.\n\nFinally, please note that the Settlement document and the Attachment are in\nWord 2000\" format.  We would be glad to provide the same documents in an\nearlier version of Word, upon request by individual Parties.\n\nWe look forward to seeing you on January 10-11.  In the meantime, we extend\nour best wishes for a safe and happy holiday season.\n\n\nFrank Lindh Ray Williams\n(415) 973-2776 (415) 973-3634\n\nPG&E Gas Accord II Settlement Proposal 12-20-00.doc>>  <<Proposed Gas\nRule 27.doc>>  <<COS & Rates Workpapers for GA II 12-20-2000 Proposal.xls>>\n\nPG&E Gas Accord II Settlement Proposal 12-20-00.doc\nProposed Gas Rule 27.doc\nCOS & Rates Workpapers for GA II 12-20-2000 Proposal.xls",

    "Body": "Today, we announced plans to merge with Dynegy, a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties.  Dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own.  We believe merging with Dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you've worked so hard to build.  Following are the major components of the transaction.\n\nDeal Terms\n\nThe transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of 0.2685 Dynegy shares for every Enron share.  For example, each 1,000 shares of Enron stock will be converted to 268 shares of Dynegy upon closing, plus cash for fractional shares, upon closing.\nChevronTexaco owns approximately 26 percent of Dynegy's outstanding common stock.  ChevronTexaco will invest $1.5 billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional $1 billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger.  Dynegy will immediately invest $1.5 billion in cash in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas.\nTotal outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares.\nThe transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close late next year.\n\nEnron will have immediate access to Dynegy's $1.5 billion cash investment in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary.\n\nManagement of Newly Formed Company\n\nChuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company, which will be called Dynegy Inc., and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO.\n\nI will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes.  I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Greg Whalley will continue to serve as president and COO of Enron until the transaction closes.  Then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Mark Frevert will continue as vice chairman of Enron.\n\nManagement from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth, efficient integration.  The make-up of the integration team has not yet been determined.\n\nThe merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2002.  This merger will create an enormous growth engine, providing great opportunities for our employees, shareholders and customers.  As with any merger, some elimination of positions is almost inevitable, and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company.  We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions.  Clearly, we cannot rule out involuntary separation, but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations.  I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible.\n\nAs I said in my video, this is a day like no other in our company's history.  We considered several options, but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses.\n\nI know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps.  We have a list of frequently asked questions posted at <http://home.enron.com/updates/>.  If you have additional questions, please submit them to questions@enron.com <mailto:questions@enron.com>.  We will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions.  If you receive any calls from the media, please refer them to our media team at (713) 853-5670.\n\nI ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company.  Rather than closing doors, we are opening new ones, as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise, including our market reach, financial strength and industry experience.  Together, we will be a new merchant powerhouse.\n\nAnd again, thank you for everything you have done for Enron.\n\n\nInvestors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint proxy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes available, because it will contain important information.  Investors and security holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospectus (when it is available) and other documents containing information about Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov.  Copies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus and the SEC filings that will be incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement/prospectus may also be obtained for free by directing a request to either:  Investor Relations, Dynegy Inc., 1000 Louisiana, Suite 5800, Houston, TX 77002, Phone:  (713) 507-6400, Fax:  (713) 507-6808; or Investor Relations, Enron Corp., 1400 Smith Street, Houston, TX 77002, Phone:  (713) 853-3956, Fax:  (713) 646-3002.\n\nIn addition, the identity of the persons who, under SEC rules, may be considered \"participants in the solicitation\" of Dynegy and Enron shareholders in connection with the proposed transactions, and any description of their direct or indirect interests, by security holdings or otherwise, are available in an SEC filing under Schedule 14A made by each of Dynegy and Enron.",

    "Body": "NGI's Daily Gas Price Index \nBreaking News : posted Jan 9, 2:28 PM\nDynegy Not Opposed to Enron Auction; Senate Subcommittee to Issue 51 Subpoenas \nNearly 20 of bankrupt Enron Corp.'s creditors have apparently filed motions to delay the scheduled auction of the company's trading assets this week, but one-time merger partner and creditor Dynegy Corp. will not be one of them, a spokesman said Wednesday. However, whether the auction proceeds as planned, Enron is facing more obstacles on the legal front with 51 subpoenas requesting documents expected to be issued Friday by the Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. \nThe U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York has been asked by the creditors to delay approving any offer for Enron's trading business, once the most profitable unit of the company. The motion to delay was requested to allow the creditors time to look at the assets up for sale. Included in the auction are assets from its EnronOnline operation, which Enron would like to use in a joint venture with a cash-rich company. \nUnder Enron's proposal, a 51% joint venture partner would form a new company with Enron to be called New Energy Trading Co., or NETCO. Enron would contribute information technology and back office systems among other things, in exchange for a 49% stake. As of late Monday, UBS AG, Citigroup Inc. and BP had made bids for some of the assets. \nAmong those opposing the auction, now set for Thursday with a decision on the winning bids as early as Friday, is the Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc, which said, \"Absent a disclosure of the intended uses for the proceeds of this sale, the creditors are unable to gauge that the benefits are adequate, appropriate and directed to the proper beneficiaries.\" Kansas City, MO-based Aquila also is opposed to the auction because of concerns about how the proceeds would be used. Aquila wants the auction's proceeds put in escrow until it is determined which units of Enron receive the money. \nHowever, Dynegy does not plan to oppose the auction, said company spokesman Steve Stengel, who also expressed surprise that any company would want to delay it. \"Dynegy has not taken any action to delay the sale of Enron's trading business,\" he told NGI. Stengel also confirmed that the scheduled sale of Northern Natural Gas Co. from Enron to Dynegy is still set to close by the end of January. \nStill to come is word on who and what documents are being subpoenaed by the Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. The subpoenas will be served on Enron, its accounting firm Andersen and 49 individual officers, employees and members of the board of directors. The subcommittee is one of five congressional panels investigating the fallen giant along with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the Department of Labor and the Department of Justice. \nThe subcommittee is looking into the role of the officers and board members, the role of the auditors, and the role of special-purpose entities,\" a subcommittee spokesman told Reuters. These are some of the same types of things being investigated by the House of Representatives Financial Services Committee, the Senate Commerce Committee and the House and Senate Energy committees. The spokesman said the subpoenas would allow Enron and the others \"several weeks\" to respond.",

        "Body": "FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE December 1, 2000\nGOVERNOR DAVIS RESPONDS TO FERC WITH INITIATIVES ON ELECTRICITY PRICES,\nSUPPLY\nSACRAMENTO - Responding to a draft proposal by the Federal Energy Regulatory\nCommission (FERC), Governor Gray Davis today announced several initiatives\nto ensure reliable and affordable electricity in California.\n\nIn a letter to the federal regulators, the Governor outlined a variety of\nregulatory and legislative actions to keep the state=01,s electricity prices at\nthe lowest reasonable cost. They include innovative measures to encourage\nthe siting of power plants in compliance with the state=01,s environmental\nlaws, restructuring the state=01,s power-buying agencies to eliminate conflicts\nof interests, and promoting energy conservation and voluntary cutbacks by\nlarger users during periods of high electricity demand.\n\nIf you do your job of protecting consumers by rectifying the wholesale\nmarkets, the steps I have to take can be transitional in nature and limited\nin scope,\" wrote Gov. Davis, who also reiterated his call to FERC to order\nretroactive refunds to San Diego and Orange County consumers, and to impose\nprice caps on the price of wholesale electricity. \"I cannot in good\nconscience, however, forego any measure that would serve to protect the\npeople of California until I am satisfied that the sellers in the wholesale\nmarkets will not victimize Californians again.\"\n\nGovernor Davis, who inherited the problems of deregulation as a result of\nlegislation signed by Governor Pete Wilson in 1996, said that \"The free\nmarket applied to electricity can work, but only if market conditions allow\nfor real competition, and if all parties act responsibly.\" The Governor\nadded \"Even though FERC had recently concluded that California=01,s market was\n01+dysfunctional,=01, its draft proposal fails to include measures to stop\nout-of-state electrical generators from price gouging, and would lead to\nhigher prices next summer.\"\n\nThe Governor=01,s proposals include:\n\nIntroducing legislation to dramatically change the membership of the ISO and\nPX, eliminating members of the board that have what he called \"inherent\nconflicts of interest\" and replacing them with independent members;\n\nSeeking legislation that will allow new approaches - such as emissions\ncredit trading - to aid in the siting of new power plants;\n\nCalling on the state=01,s Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to promote\ndistributed generation and co-generation;\n\nAccelerating voluntary efforts by the private sector as well as state\nagencies to reduce their energy use during peak periods;\n\nExpanding \"forward contracting\" by utilities that would allow multi-year\ncontracts to reduce price volatility and ensure reliability;\n\nAsking the PUC to expedite its investigation of the state=01,s electricity\ndemand reduction programs for commercial users, and adopt new programs to\nallow voluntary interruptions that will allow the reduction of electricity\nuse during peak power periods;\n\nReviewing new measures to coordinate power-plant maintenance and operating\nactivities;\n\nRequiring utilities to retain their existing generation facilities instead\nof selling them off at least until the market becomes competitive; and\n\nCalling on the PUC and California Energy Commission (CEC) to study providing\nreal time price signals\" (such as metering) to large energy users to reduce\nenergy use.\n\nGovernor Davis noted that in the decade prior to his administration, no\npower plants were built in the state. But since April 1999, six power plants\nrepresenting 4,700 MW of new generation have been approved. Twenty more\napplications are under review and 11 more are in the pipeline.\n\nThis represents a significant change in policy and performance and responds\nto the fact that we must increase supply as rapidly as possible without\nabrogating our commitment to state and federal public health and\nenvironmental protection,\" he said.\n\nThe Governor=01,s initiatives announced today reflects his commitment to FERC\nChairman James Hoecker at a hearing last month in San Diego to provide input\ninto FERC=01,s final order on the California electricity market. That decision\ncould come as early as December 13, 2000.\n\nThe Governor will continue to meet with legislative leaders, consumer\ngroups, and other interested parties to discuss additional options. He said\na more complete plan cannot be developed until FERC=01,s final order has been\nannounced and analyzed."

Still, those companies that own generation in the state say they\nwelcome the probe into the power market by Attorney General Bill Lockyer.\nWe have done nothing wrong at all,\" said Tom Williams, spokesman for Duke\nEnergy North America (DUK). \"Our plants have been running all summer long.\nPrices are high throughout the west. We wouldn't invest $1.7 billion in new\ngeneration and then try and rig the market.\"  For the past two months,\nutilities, lawmakers and other market participants have made allegations\nthat generators are manipulating the market and are largely responsible for\nthe price spikes.  Locker's office said an investigation is still pending.\nState regulators are also conducting their own investigation, the findings\nof which will be submitted to the governor and the Federal Energy Regulatory\nCommission by the end of the year.  Allegations Said Unsubstantiated  There\nisn't a shred of evidence to support allegations, said Severing Borenstein,\ndirector of the University of California, Berkley's, Energy Institute.\nThere are no antitrust laws that state you can't charge a premium price for\npower,\" Borenstein said. \"Manipulation is a bad word. That's used in the\ncommodities market to find a loophole and take advantage of the rules.  \"I\nwould say this is exercising market power. ... If you want to charge high\nprices you can. These are guys who play against each other every day. There\nis no sort of collusion that would interest the justice department ... .\"\nThe reason for the inquiry ordered By Gov. Gray Davis, he said, is as a\nconsequence of San Diego consumers being the first in the nation to pay\nmarket-based rates for electricity.  The high wholesale costs paid by\nutility San Diego Gas & Electric, a unit of Sempra Energy (SRE), were passed\non to ratepayers and resulted in utility bills more than doubling.  Gov.\nDavis ordered the inquiry and asked federal regulators to conduct their own\ninvestigation as well.  Dynegy (DYN) President Steve Bergstrom also says\nthat an investigation \"will turn up nothing.\"  So why conduct one?  \"This is\na very politically charged issue,\" Bergstrom said. \"When something goes\nwrong you have to find someone to point the finger at.\"  A source in the\ngovernor's office said Davis is aware that Attorney General Lockyer's\ninvestigation may turn up nothing, but Gov. Davis \"has a responsibility to\nhis constituents.\"  Supply vs. Demand  What the investigation will turn up\nis evidence that there is a shortage of power in the state and not enough\npower plants being built to meet increasing demand, said Terry Winter,\nchairman and chief executive officer of the California Independent System\nOperator.  Winter said he doesn't believe that there is anything wrong with\nthe way generators sell their power and 98% of the time the market works\nwell.  \"Is it market abuse to bid at the price cap ($250 per megawatt-hour)\nknowing that you're 1,000 MW short? I have trouble identifying that as\nmarket power abuse,\" Winter said.  Despite some proposed regulatory changes,\nsuch as bid caps on wholesale energy prices and a rate freeze for SDG&E\ncustomers, Duke Energy, Dynegy, Southern Co. (SO) and Reliant (RLI) all\nstill plan to invest in generation in the state.  That's a different stance\nthan the companies took a month ago when the ISO reduced the wholesale price\ncap in the real-time market to $250/MWh.  \"At the end of the day the market\nis short power and you got to get people to build new generation,\" said\nDynegy's Bergstrom. \"We got a big investment in California. We're not\nwalking away from that.\"  -By Jason Leopold, Dow Jones Newswires;\n323-658-3874; jason.leopold@dowjones.com Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones &\nCompany Inc\n12:15 GMT 16 August 2000 DJ Calif ISO Urges FERC To Reject Pwr Producers'\nComplaint\nThis article was originally published Tuesday)\nWASHINGTON (Dow Jones)--California's power grid administrator Monday urged\nfederal regulators to reject a complaint from power producers seeking\ncompensation in the event out-of-state power transactions are curtailed\nduring an extreme power grid emergency.\nThe independent system operator told the Federal Energy Regulatory\nCommission that the power producers seek compensation in the event of a\nsituation that never has occurred any time since the ISO began operations,\nand if it were to occur in the future, would do so rarely.\"\nThe ISO noted that its tariff governing access to the state's grid already\nallows for compensation in the event of curtailed exports, and decried the\npower producers' complaint as \"a collateral attack\" on a previous FERC order\nrejecting claims that the tariff failed to provide adequate compensation.\nCurtailing scheduled power transactions and exports would be a last resort\nmeasure taken only after other options have been exhausted, the ISO said.\nThe power producers should adjust their contracts to factor in the risk of\ninterruption in the event of a state-wide grid emergency, the ISO said.\nThe ISO's objections were echoed by the state's electricity distribution\nutilities and California regulators.\nThey complained that the power producers are merely trying to get out from\nunder the price controls the ISO has imposed in an effort to rein in\nskyrocketing power prices this summer.\nThe generators \"knew when they purchased California power plants and when\nthey entered into their export contracts that the ISO could alter their\nschedules in an emergency. For them to ask the commission to make it even\nmore expensive, and hence, more difficult, for the ISO to maintain grid\nreliability in California is irresponsible,\" said Southern California\nEdison, a unit of Edison International (EIX).\nThe complaint is a sham,\" declared the California Public Utilities\nCommission.\nThe true intent of the complaint ... is to avoid the ISO price caps by\nmaking sales to affiliates or cooperating entities located out of state, and\nsell the power back to the ISO at uncapped prices reflecting the generators'\nmarket power,\" the PUC said, calling for FERC to summarily reject the\ncomplaint.\nThe complaint is factually unsupported, legally unfounded, complains of\nconduct consistent with the ISO's authority under pertinent FERC decisions,\nand seeks to avoid the price cap,\" the PUC said.\nBut power marketers and other power producers voiced support for the\ncomplaint, filed Aug. 3 by Reliant Power Generation Inc. (REI), Dynegy Power\nMarketing Inc. (DYN) and Southern Energy California (SO).\nBy subjecting curtailed energy transactions to its maximum purchase price\nof $250, and simply ignoring the financial impact on sellers, the Cal ISO\nwould be overtly discriminating against export transactions and market\nparticipants who schedule energy for export,\" said the Electric Power Supply\nAssociation, the national trade group representing competitive power\nproducers.\nIt is critical that power producers ... know with certainty that the\ncurtailment of scheduled energy exports by Cal ISO will be compensated,\"\nsaid Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc.\nNow that the ISO Governing Board has lowered purchase price caps to $250,\nit is significantly more likely that the curtailment of exports will occur\nmore frequently. Less energy will be imported into California and more\nenergy will leave California in search of higher prices,\" said Williams\nEnergy Marketing & Trading Co. in support of the complaint's call for actual\ndamages and lost opportunity costs.\nAt least one power purchaser voiced support for the producers' position as\nwell.\nIt seems a very basic point that if the Cal ISO must divert the\ntransactions of others to meet its own loads, that is should pay the full\ncosts of doing so,\" said the Northern California Power Agency.\nBy Bryan Lee, Dow Jones Newswires; 202-862-6647; bryan.lee@dowjones.com\nCopyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company Inc\n\n\nG_nther A.

    "Body": "RTO Week\n\nDay 3 -- October 17, 2001\n\nStandardizing RTO Tariffs\n\nThe morning panel focused on which transmission services should be standardized in RTO tariffs across an interconnection or the entire country.  There were many diverse views on the panel, and the Staff and commissioners were somewhat more engaged in this session.  \n\nThe panelists were:  Ricky Bittle, Arkansas Electric Coop; Jim Caldwell, American Wind; Peter Esposito, Dynegy; Rory McMinn, New Mexico PSC; Glenn Ross, Dominion Resources; Audrey Zibelman, XCEL Energy.\n\nGeneral Observations\n\nThis panel had a lot less agreement than the previous panels.  Dynegy opposes standardization of a transmission tariff and urges FERC to give strong guidance to stakeholders and then let the stakeholders work out the details of a new tariff.  Dominion advocates a more prescriptive approach by FERC, noting that stakeholders have been unable to reach agreement over the last five years.  EXCEL has it's own focus - they want to be an ITC and want to provide many of the RTO services without being an RTO.  The Wind group is mostly concerned about the ability to provide generation on an \"as available\" basis. The commissioner from New Mexico does not want standardization, does not want FERC stepping on the state's jurisdictional toes, and does not want New Mexico ratepayers' rates to go up.  Arkansas Electric Coop insists that SPP transmission capacity is full, so if competitors want to move power through SPP, new transmission must first be built.\n\nI am somewhat concerned that some of the Commissioners may believe that tariff standardization is not necessary.  While the Dynegy concept had merit at one time, it may be too late to rely on the stakeholder process to resolve issues, and it could take many months to go through the process, only to have FERC, in the end, decide the details anyway.  We may want to submit comments on this issue to FERC at the conclusion of RTO Week.\n\nWhat Services Should be Standardized?\n\nOverall, Dynegy opposes standardizing tariffs but believes certain aspects of reservations should be standardized -- timing, confirmation processing, maintenance issues, bus names, ramping protocols, assumptions for ATC calculations, posting times, bumping rules, and settlement time.  With regard to congestion management, it should not be standardized between RTOs.  \n\nXCEL does not support a standardized tariff but urges FERC to standardize some issues such as CBM calculations, reserve obligations and load balancing and penalties.  American Wind says FERC must focus on having liquid spot markets in RTOs and not worry about tariff standardization.  Dominion cautions FERC about Dynegy's proposal to let the industry work out the details.  He says this is what happened with Order No. 2000 and the industry was unable to work it out.  \n\nShould FERC Retain CBM?\n\nRicky (Arkansas Coop) believes that the bigger the RTO, the less important CBM is because the RTO will have enough resources internally to effectuate reserve sharing.  Dynegy thinks CBM should be eliminated.  Dominion thinks CBM should be retained but the rules need to be changed.  CBM should not be set for a year - it changes on a daily basis and this should be reflected.  Nor should CBM be standardized because needs vary region to region.  However, because CBM is used for load, the cost of CBM should be allocated to load.  All panelists agreed with the concept that if CBM is retained, load should be required to purchase it as a service provided under the tariff.\n\nNetwork Versus Point to Point Service\n\nPeter (Dynegy) discussed the need to develop a new type of transmission service that combines the best features from network and point to point, similar to transportation service offered in gas -- firm and interruptible.  Peter suggests starting with the CRT tariff proposed several years ago.  Glenn (Dominion) thinks the CRT is outdated and thinks we need a new type of service but agrees that it should combine the best elements of network and point to point.  \n\nShould all Transmission Service Be Under the RTO's Tariff?\n\nMost of the panelists said yes, all service should be under the tariff, but Ricky Bittle said there needs to be a transition period - minimum of 5 years, no more than 10 years.  Commissioner McMinn said no - he sees this as an infringement on the states' jurisdiction.\n\nWhat Services Need to Be Changed Under a New RTO Tariff?\n\nJim (Wind) believes that the imbalance provisions must be revised so as not to penalize \"as available\" resources.  Ricky thinks transmission expansion is the most important issue to address in a new tariff.  XCEL urges FERC to recognize the distinction between RTOs and ITCs and allow ITCs to design and offer their own transmission tariffs.\n\nRay Alvarez will circulate a summary of the afternoon panel on Cost Allocation.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions.\n\nSarah",

    "Body": "On Wed, I met at EPSA to discuss with members - the near term future \nparticipation of EPSA staff and members at NERC.\n\nA roster of participants follows this brief summary.\n\nMost members agreed in concept that NERC must continue to be monitored at \nleast in the near term because of their \"monopoly\" on the \nreliability/commercial rules.  There was agreement that NERC had moved into \nthe commercial/non-reliability standards setting partly becuase the \nincumbants desgined it that way and partly due to a lack of another industry \nrepresentative forum  for FERC to delegate to.  Some members were encouraged \nthat GISB was interested in becoming an alternative forum (EISB) and pointed \nto GISB successes in creating an efficient Bulletin Board for Gas in response \nto FERC orders.  The members also realized that most of the NERC problems are \ncaused by the native load exception which the gas industry did not have to \ndeal with making their restructuring easier.\n\nEPSA staff will focus on representing EPSA members' viewpoints to the \nindependent board members to establish working relationships and to provide \nmarket perspectives as well as governance problems within the NERC \nstructure.  \n\nMany EPSA members also felt that EPSA staff could do more to provide \ninformation regarding NERC issues that affect the markets so that a greater \nnumber of members can convey their positions to the NERC Committee and \nSubcommittee market representatives. Some possible email/members only \nbulletin board was discussed.\n\nReliant (John Orr) also expressed concern over continuing to allow NERC (as \nopposed to the RTOs)  to set the commercial standards.  Most agreed that NERC \ndoes not design efficient commercial/market standards and should leave the \nnon-reliablity rules to RTOs.  Others (myself, DENA, Ontario Power Gen) who \nparticipate on NERC groups agreed to this in concept but raised the problem \nthat many of the reliability rules overlap commercial rules with no \"bright \nline\" between the two.\n\nPlease contact me if you wish more details of the meeting.\nCharles Yeung\nX30348\n\nParticipants in person:\nCalpine - Jim Stanton\nDuke Energy NA - Lee Barrett, Mike Gildea\nDynegy - Mary Doyle, John Stauffacher\nEl Paso - Susan Ginsberg\nEnron - Charles Yeung\nOntario Power Gen - Barb Robertson\nPG&E - Jack Hawks\nReliant - John Orr\nPSEG - Dennis Sobieski\nEPSA - Mark Bennett, Lynne Church, Julie Simon\n\nParticipating via phone:\nBP Energy - Jeanne Zaiontz\nCalpine - Jana Phillips\nEdison Mission - Gail Chandler\nMirant - Pamela Hill\nTenaska - Mark Foreman\nTECO - Janet Sena\nWilliams - Mike Grim, Jane Mudgett",
