        "Subject": "ALERT:  As discussed yesterday, Davis publicly demands nearly $9",
        "Body": "billion for electricity overcharges...\n\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) California Gov. Gray Davis demanded that power\ngenerators refund nearly $9 billion in electricity overcharges and\ncomplained that federal regulators have ``looked the other way\nwhile energy companies bilked our state.''\nDavis told a Senate hearing Wednesday that the decision by the\nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission to curtail price spikes in\nCalifornia and 10 other Western states was a step forward.\nBut its actions do nothing about the overcharges'' over the\npast year, he said.\nThe governor, a Democrat, has been criticized by Republicans,\nwho charge he has allowed the California power crisis to get out of\nhand.\nDavis defended his actions, saying the state has stepped up\napproval for new power plants and strengthened conservation\nprograms. He also said the state has little control over price\ngouging by out-of-state power generators.\nThe governor once said he could solve California's problems in\n15 minutes. ... But it appears that California has continued to try\nand hide the true cost of power by having the state pay for it\ninstead of the utilities,'' putting California taxpayers in\njeopardy, said Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska.\nMurkowski said many of the alleged overcharges are by public\npower entities not under FERC jurisdiction\nSen. Joe Lieberman, D-Conn., chairman of the Governmental\nAffairs Committee, said the FERC, which regulates wholesale\nelectricity sales, has been slow to respond and ``surprisingly\nreluctant'' to assure that electricity prices are just and\nreasonable, as required by the 1934 Federal Power Act.\nThe agency's response to the Western power problem ``raises\nserious questions about whether (FERC) has or will oversee the\nnewly deregulated energy markets'' not only in the West but across\nthe rest of the country.\nThe federal agency, whose commissioners were to testify later in\nthe day, imposed limited, market-based price caps on Monday in\nCalifornia and 10 other Western states from Washington to Arizona.\nThe agency also ordered the parties to attend a conference next\nweek to try to work out agreements on overcharges and other issues.\nMonths ago, the FERC singled out $124 million in alleged\novercharges by power generators. The power companies have since\nchallenged the agency's findings and the matter remains in dispute.\nTo date not a single penny in refunds has been returned to\nCalifornia,'' complained Davis. He said that between May 2000 and\nthe beginning of this month power generators are believed to have\novercharged California $8.9 billion.\nThey must be required to give us back our money,'' said Davis.\nIt is unconscionable that FERC looked the other way while energy\ncompanies bilked our state for up to $9 billion.''\nThe state spent $7 billion for electricity in 1999 and $27\nbillion in 2000 and is projected to pay nearly $50 billion this\nyear, said Davis.\nPower generators have been able to exert extreme power over\nour energy market,'' he said.\nDavis rejected Republican criticism that the state is not\naddressing the problem. He said newly approved power plants will\nprovide 20,000 additional megawatts of electricity by 2003,\nincluding 4,000 megawatts by the end of this summer.\nEverything that can be done to bring reliable, affordable\nenergy to California is being done ... except wholesale price\nrelief,'' he said.\nThis administration has minimized this crisis (for) more\nmonths,'' said Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., alluding to President\nBush's repeated refusal to urge the FERC to mitigate electricity\nprices. Bush has strongly opposed price controls, although he\nindicated support for FERC's limited price mitigation effort this\nweek.\nMurray said the government should issue a disaster declaration\nso that businesses can get low-income loans, and require that FERC\npress its investigation into price gouging and demand refunds not\nonly in California but in the Pacific Northwest, where electricity\nprices have also skyrocketed.\nRepublicans continued their opposition to more stringent price\ncaps based on the cost of generation at individual power plants.\nHaving a federal agency try to determine what is a just and\nreasonable price is laughable,'' said Sen. Fred Thompson of\nTennessee, the committee's ranking Republican. Hard price caps\ndon't work when supply is the problem. ... They make a bad\nsituation worse,'' he said.\nAfter FERC issued its limited price control order this week,\nSenate Democrats on Tuesday said they would drop legislation to\nrequire more stringent cost-based price caps on Western electricity\nsales.\nDemocrats in the House, however, said they would continue to\npursue a bill requiring the FERC to take more aggressive action."

    "Body": "Borderline\nNo.  2001-22\nOctober 30, 2001<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = \"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office\" />\n\n\nNovember 1 Tariff Change\n\nTariff revisions detailing and addressing the use of an Operational Flow Order (OFO) on Northern Border, which were part of Northern Border's approved Park and Loan (PAL) filing, will become effective on November 1. Here is a brief overview of the upcoming changes.\n\n\nPurpose of an OFO\n\nAn OFO will be used by Northern Border to 1) alleviate conditions that threaten the integrity of the system, 2) maintain pipeline operations at pressures required to provide efficient and reliable transportation service, 3) assure adequate system line pack, and 4) maintain service for all of Northern Border's firm shippers. \n\nAn OFO will be treated as a tool of last resort.  Northern Border will first attempt to utilize its system, its services (transportation and PAL), and if necessary, assistance of interconnecting systems to alleviate operational problems before invoking its OFO tariff provisions.\n\n\nPosting of an OFO Watch\n\nIf resolution of an operational problem is unlikely, such as when a daily or cumulative OBA imbalance with an interconnected party is outside of a defined tolerance range, Northern Border will post an OFO watch.  Similar to a severe weather notice, the purpose of an OFO watch is to pre-alert shippers and interconnecting systems to a location or area on Northern Border's system in which underlying operational conditions could prompt the issuance of an OFO.\n\n\nOFO Issuance\n\nNorthern Border will issue an OFO if it is determined that an OFO watch has failed to serve as a catalyst for corrective action. \n\nA Northern Border OFO will be as localized as is reasonably possible.  Furthermore, each OFO will be tailored to match the severity of the known or anticipated problem being addressed.\n\n\nOFO Impact\n\nAn OFO can result in either the curtailment of interruptible services and/or the forced balancing of nominations and actual flows through the confirmation process. \n\nIf service is reduced or interrupted due to an OFO, Northern Border will directly provide affected shippers, as soon as possible, a summary of the service interruption that will include the operational variables that prompted such action.  In addition, affected shippers will be notified of any imbalances that require immediate resolution.\n\nRoutine status updates will be posted throughout the period in which the OFO is in effect.\n\n\nFailure to Comply\n\nWhen an OFO is issued, it is the responsibility of the affected shippers to make a good faith effort to comply.  If such shippers fail to respond to the OFO, or their response is insufficient to correct the problem, Northern Border may take further action including the curtailment of firm service or the immediate cash out of cumulative imbalances that are in excess of 10% of the Historical Flow Quantity.\n\nNorthern Border will not be liable for any costs incurred by a shipper in complying with or be exposed to any damages that result from an interruption in service due to an OFO.\n\n\nImpact of OFO Tariff Changes on Interconnects\n\nFERC Order No. 637 requires that pipelines \"take all reasonable actions to minimize the issuance and adverse impact of Operational Flow Orders (OFOs).\"  Northern Border recognizes that maintaining daily and cumulative OBA imbalances with its interconnected parties within reasonable tolerances levels is critical in meeting such obligation across the grid.  Consequently, the November 1 tariff changes includes language which define what is an acceptable tolerance range on a Northern Border OBA imbalance.\n\nTo serve as a benchmark, Northern Border has already begun calculating a Historical Flow Quantity (HFQ) for each point of interconnection on Northern Border's system.  The HFQ is the lesser of the average daily scheduled quantity for the previous 15 consecutive Gas Days or the actual daily flow quantity for such time period. \n\nOn November 1, the default cumulative OBA imbalance tolerance level for a given interconnect on Northern Border's system will be +/- 10% of the point's HFQ. If such approach fails to meet the needs of an interconnected party, Northern Border's tariff does permit the use of an alternative tolerance level at a given point of interconnect as long as it has been mutually agreed to both OBA parties.\n\nFurthermore, the daily OBA swings at interconnects on Northern Border that are on pressure control will also be monitored more closely; the default daily OBA imbalance tolerance level will be +/- 5% of the daily scheduled quantity.  Once again, Northern Border's tariff does permit deviation from this \"standardized\" daily tolerance if an alternative method is mutually acceptable to the OBA parties. \n\nFor those who would like to initiate discussions on establishing OBA imbalance tolerance levels with Northern Border that deviate from the defaults described above, please contact Scott Coburn at (402) 398.7760.",

Enron et al were concerned that the RTO initiatives underway \nwere independently developing RTOs with little emphasis on coordination with \nneighboring business practices.  \n\nAt the May 30, 2001 FERC meeting, Chairman Hebert announced this FERC \ntechnical conference may be scheduled as early as June.  This is a reversal \nof the Chairman's earlier resistance to holding a technical conference when \nhe instead favored the RTO filing process to individually address \ninterregional coordination.\n\nThe key to the Chairman's change in direction can be attributed to Enron's \nactive participation on the Electronic Scheduling Collaborative (ESC) a \nnon-NERC industry collaborative effort formed to respond to the FERC ANOPR on \nOASIS Phase II.  \n\nBy working through a EPSA/ELCON joint filing in response to the ESC filing, \nEnron was able to raise awareness of the seams coordination threats to OASIS \nPhase II development and successfully sway the ESC to file in support of the \nearlier EPSA/ELCON/Enron/Reliant/Dynegy Request for Technical Conference. \n\nGovt Affairs will continue to monitor the development of the Technical \nConference and provide needed support to resolve inter-RTO seams issues.\n\nCharles Yeung\nGovt Affairs NA\n713-853-0348",

Items of \ninterest:\n\nThird party studies may be used upon mutual agreement between SPP and \nCustomer; however, SPP is not required to allow a third party contractor in \nany instance that it cannot meet the time frames for study completion.\nThe current queued customer will bear the costs of completing a new study if \nsomeone in the queue before it withdraws.  (Dynegy asked that the withdrawing \ncustomer should pay for any new studies required by others.)\nWhile SPP is required to provide notice if the study will take more than 60 \ndays, it is not bound to complete a study in 60 days (if more time is \nreasonably needed.)\nIf transmission is not purchased, the customer is responsible for the costs \nof upgrades that are needed \"but for\" the interconnection.  However, once \ntransmission is requested, SPP is limited to charging the higher of (i) the \nnetwork upgrade expansion cost or (ii) an embedded cost rate which has the \nexpansion cost rolled-in.  This is similar to pricing on pipelines.  \nTypically, Enron would not want to pay for network upgrades (as opposed to \nthe interconnection alone costs) without obtaining the transmission right on \nOASIS.  This order does advance the argument that network upgrades which \nbenefit the system (other customers) should be paid for in rates to all \ncustomers.\n\nLet me know if you would like a copy of the order."

    "Body": "Today, we announced plans to merge with Dynegy, a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties.  Dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own.  We believe merging with Dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you've worked so hard to build.  Following are the major components of the transaction.\n\nDeal Terms\n\nThe transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of 0.2685 Dynegy shares for every Enron share.  For example, each 1,000 shares of Enron stock will be converted to 268 shares of Dynegy upon closing, plus cash for fractional shares, upon closing.\nChevronTexaco owns approximately 26 percent of Dynegy's outstanding common stock.  ChevronTexaco will invest $1.5 billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional $1 billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger.  Dynegy will immediately invest $1.5 billion in cash in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas.\nTotal outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares.\nThe transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close late next year.\n\nEnron will have immediate access to Dynegy's $1.5 billion cash investment in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary.\n\nManagement of Newly Formed Company\n\nChuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company, which will be called Dynegy Inc., and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO.\n\nI will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes.  I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Greg Whalley will continue to serve as president and COO of Enron until the transaction closes.  Then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Mark Frevert will continue as vice chairman of Enron.\n\nManagement from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth, efficient integration.  The make-up of the integration team has not yet been determined.\n\nThe merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2002.  This merger will create an enormous growth engine, providing great opportunities for our employees, shareholders and customers.  As with any merger, some elimination of positions is almost inevitable, and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company.  We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions.  Clearly, we cannot rule out involuntary separation, but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations.  I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible.\n\nAs I said in my video, this is a day like no other in our company's history.  We considered several options, but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses.\n\nI know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps.  We have a list of frequently asked questions posted at <http://home.enron.com/updates/>.  If you have additional questions, please submit them to questions@enron.com <mailto:questions@enron.com>.  We will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions.  If you receive any calls from the media, please refer them to our media team at (713) 853-5670.\n\nI ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company.  Rather than closing doors, we are opening new ones, as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise, including our market reach, financial strength and industry experience.  Together, we will be a new merchant powerhouse.\n\nAnd again, thank you for everything you have done for Enron.\n\n\nInvestors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint proxy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes available, because it will contain important information.  Investors and security holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospectus (when it is available) and other documents containing information about Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov.  Copies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus and the SEC filings that will be incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement/prospectus may also be obtained for free by directing a request to either:  Investor Relations, Dynegy Inc., 1000 Louisiana, Suite 5800, Houston, TX 77002, Phone:  (713) 507-6400, Fax:  (713) 507-6808; or Investor Relations, Enron Corp., 1400 Smith Street, Houston, TX 77002, Phone:  (713) 853-3956, Fax:  (713) 646-3002.\n\nIn addition, the identity of the persons who, under SEC rules, may be considered \"participants in the solicitation\" of Dynegy and Enron shareholders in connection with the proposed transactions, and any description of their direct or indirect interests, by security holdings or otherwise, are available in an SEC filing under Schedule 14A made by each of Dynegy and Enron.",

    "Body": "Several thoughts from federal reg./transmission side:\nI haven't worked with a VEPCO interconnection agreement yet, but many times \nthere are requirements that the generator is required to provide emergency \npower to the interconnected transmission provider, in which case you would \nwant the interconnection agreement to cover all costs you would incur to \nreplace the energy at a different location (usually it is difficult to get \nthis agreement, so you should check and then factor that into the equation).  \nI would be happy to look at the interconnection agreement with you.\nInterconnection of generation is a separate process from requesting \ntransmission.  It appears that VEPCO has to buy the transmission (or use its \nnetwork transmission) when the Delivery Point is the plant.  Enron will have \nto purchase transmission on VEPCO if it is selling to third parties off the \nplant and will have to purchase transmission on other systems if it wants to \nsupply at an alternate delivery point.  Please discuss this with Kevin \nPresto's tranmission people (Bill Rust on 31).  Enron cannot use VEPCO's \nnetwork transmission to delivery to third parties.\nIs this plant in the VEPCO queue yet?  Also, FERC has issued some recent \nrulings that deal with time limits on system impact studies, etc.  While \nVEPCO is probably incentivized to get this built, you want to make sure that \nyou do not lose optionality in selling to third parties from the plant due to \ntransmission constraints.  A request for transmission on OASIS is the only \nway to ensure deliverability to third parties.\n3.5 (c) Intra-day scheduling--You may have hourly transmission risk for an \nincrease.  Unless you buy longer term firm, you will deliver from other \nsources using hourly non-firm, which is the lowest priority of transmission \nand subject to getting cut.  You may want to consider doing this on \nbest/reasonable efforts basis.  (Also, even if you purchase \ndaily/monthly/yearly firm to serve third parties, if you change the point of \nreceipt or point of delivery temporarily, your request is treated as \nnon-firm.)\n12.4--Currently VEPCO is interested in joining the Alliance ISO (an RTO that \nhas not been approved by FERC yet--competing ISO to Midwest ISO), but since \nFERC has not approved any RTO for VEPCO yet, there could be significant \nchanges in the transmission charges/methods of obtaining \ntransmission/grandfathering of current transmission, etc during this \ncontract.  Make sure with the ENA attorneys that this out/increase in price \ncovers that circumstance.\nUnderlying tranmission rates on VEPCO or any other provider can change at \nmost any time, subject to the provider filing a rate case.  Therefore, any \ncurrent transmission rates shown on OASIS are not necessarily what you will \npay over the term of any transmission that Enron may purchase to serve this \ncontract.  Generally, transmission providers will not agree to fixed rates.\n\n\nTom Chapman\n06/13/2000 06:07 PM",

        "Body": "Christi--\n\nThis is the note that I received on Tuesday June 13.  This is a relatively \nearly draft of the PPA.\n\nI think that we still have to purchase the land associated with the sites and \ndo the due diligence on the site with regards to some of the siting issues.  \nIN addition, in NC we are going to get a CPCN to site the plant to speed up \nthe regulatory process in the NCUC.  I think that this will make the issue \nless contentious because of the NCUC's acceptance of the Dynegy plant at \nRockingham that had a PPA with Duke Power.  \n\nUsing the Dynegy plant as a guideline, their only stumbling block was their \ngas agreeement.  They built a bypass off Transco.  We would be taking gas \nfrom the LDC of Rocky Mount.  Having talked with the regulatory folks at the \nNCUC who handle gas issues, this is the preferred route.  So, I do not think \nthat we have any major state issues.  I think that right now we are simply \nworking on some of the siting issues.\n\nThat being said, I will let you take a look at the PPA and let me know or \nJeff Keenan (or even Heather Kroll or Ozzie Pagan) if you think that there \nare some transmission issues or other issues on the federal level.  \n\nThanks.\n\nTom\nForwarded by Tom Chapman/HOU/ECT on 06/13/2000 06:04 \n\n\nLinda J Simmons\n06/13/2000 08:45 AM"

        "Body": "Lisa:  Attached is a draft of the Power Purchase Agreement with VEPCO, based \non the current version of the term sheet.  In preparing the draft, we did \nencounter several additional questions for Enron's consideration.  These are \nnoted with brackets and, in some cases, italicized notes, in the draft and \nare also highlighted below.  You may want to address these issues before this \ngoes to VEPCO.\n\nCover and first page-- Should the party to the agreement (for the moment) be \nENA or a special purpose company?\n\nDefinitions--  We included a defined term \"Emergency Start-Up\" (a start up or \nincrease in energy scheduled during a day) and a place in Exhibit A to \ninclude a price for this, although this was not covered in the term sheet.\n\nSection 2.2--  We included a provision for VEPCO to take test energy (energy \ncharge only; no demand charge)--do you want this?\n\nSection 2.3--  This was taken from the term sheet, but is it correct that COD \nwill be July 1 (since the demand charge is supposed to start June 1?)  Also, \nit would be best to define \"commencement of construction\" to avoid \ncontroversy down the road.  We could either do this now or put in a \nplaceholder that indicates it needs to be defined or be silent, whichever is \nyour preference.  Also, bear in mind that we have not included a specific \nremedy (e.g., liquidated damages) if the Seller does not achieve that \nmilestone on time.  Under the default provision (Section 8.1(c)), there would \nbe a 30 day period to cure before Buyer could terminate (extendible to 90 \ndays if a longer period of time is needed and Seller diligently pursues the \ncure).  Would you prefer the right to pay ld's and extend the time period?\n\nSection 3.1(b)--  Should the 1400 hour limitation apply to all sales under \nthis PPA or only sales from the Facility?  I.e., would you use this Agreement \nto sell to VEPCO power in addition to what would be available from the \nFacility?  Also, is this a calendar year limitation--i.e., could they take \n1400 hours in the period June-Dec. 2001 or does the 1400 hours need to be \npro-rated for the first year?\n\nSection 3.4-- Since this is not a base load plant, the normal definition of \nAvailability as the number of hours in a year of operations compared to the \ntotal hours in the year would not seem to be applicable.  Instead, we stated \nthat the Facility would be capable of being available 92% of the year (other \nthan due to Force Majeure and 336 hours (2 weeks) of scheduled \nmaintenance)--i.e., that if they tried to schedule it, it is expected to be \navailable.  Is that what Enron intended?  Additionally, the term sheet stated \nthat a remedy for failure to meet Availability would need to be agreed--why \nwouldn't cost of cover damages be appropriate? Also, please note that we \nincluded language stating that Seller will not perform maintenance during \npeak periods.\n\nSection 3.5(b)-- Please note the bracketed language re taking Blocks of \nEnergy.  We have 50 MW minimum blocks but the capacity is 223--should we \nallow the last Block to be 23 if they've scheduled all the rest?\n\nSection 3.5(c)-- Please see the bracketed language at the end of this Section.\n\nSection 4.7-- Should there a required minimum take of Energy?\n\nArticle 6-- The Genco/Santee Cooper form of PPA we used as a model did not \nhave any provisions on metering.  (See placeholder note in Article 6.)  Do \nyou want to add such a provision, ignore it or just include a placeholder for \nnow?\n\nSection 9.1-- Is 30 days from invoice correct for the payment due date or \nwould you prefer a shorter period?\n\nArticle 15-- The Genco/Santee Cooper form had mediation as a required step \nprior to arbitration.  Should we keep that?  Also, the form of arbitration is \nbaseball\" arbitration--i.e.,  the arbitrators have to chose one party's \nposition or the other's.  Is that what you want?\n\nSection 16.2--  We used New York for governing law, on the premise that it \nwill be difficult to get VEPCO to agree to Texas law and we would not \nrecommend Virginia law for this contract.\n\nExhibit A-- There are a number of questions on the pricing exhibit--please \nsee the bracketed notes therein.\n\nPlease call and let us know how you would like to proceed on this draft.\n\nVEPPPA.DOC"

    "Body": "Dear Generation/Power Marketing Executive:\n\nThe following is this week's Alliance Express newsletter, and a special \nannouncement regarding a proposed action by the Financial Accounting \nStandards Board (FASB).\n\nFASB 133\nFASB is considering an exception to Statement of Financial Accounting \nStandards (SFAS) No. 133 that will exempt energy companies from the \nrequirement to account for capacity contracts as derivatives.  A vote against \nthe exception would result in a significant increase in earnings volatility, \nand raises other important concerns for energy suppliers.  (Attached is a \nsummary of this issue.)  The Board is expected to vote on this issue during \nMay 2001.  EEI will be taking steps to appraise FASB of our concerns.  If \nyou, or company CFO would like more information about this effort, please \ncontact Richard McMahon, Executive Director of the Alliance of Energy \nSuppliers, at rmcmahon@eei.org, or at 202-508-5571.\n\n\nAlliance of Energy Suppliers Express=02=05April 25, \n2001\nINSIDE WASHINGTON\n\nFEDERAL AFFAIRS\n\nBill Repealing PUHCA Is Approved By Senate Committee***\nThe Senate Banking Committee today approved S 206, a bill that repeals the \nPublic Utility Holding Company Act of 1935.  The bill would repeal PUHCA and \ntransfer oversight of public utility holding companies from the Securities \nand Exchange Commission to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and \nappropriate state agencies.\nS.206 was approved with two amendments.  Offered by Sen. Mike Enzi (R-WY), \nthe first amendment would establish the Electric Energy Market Competition \nTask Force to study competition in the wholesale and retail market for \nelectric energy in the United States. The task force would be made up of \nrepresentatives of FERC, the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade \nCommission, as well as non-voting representatives from the Department of \nAgriculture and the Securities and Exchange Commission. The amendment also \ncontained a provision, co-sponsored by Sen. Paul Sarbanes (D-MD), that would \npreserve FERC's authority to require that energy rates are reasonable and do \nnot include the pass-through of holding company costs that are unrelated to \nenergy.\nAnother amendment, offered by Sen. Jon Corzine (D-NJ), initiated a study by \nthe General Accounting Office of the success of federal and state governments \nin preventing anticompetitive practices by public utility holding companies \nand in promoting competition and efficient energy markets.\n\nInstitute=02=07s Tax Agreement With Public Power Again Introduced on Hill***\n\nThe tax agreement EEI reached with the American Public Power Association \nAPPA) and the Large Public Power Council (LPPC) again has been introduced in \nthe House.  The bill (HR 1459) contains the same provisions as were in a \nmeasure (HR 4971), with technical corrections, introduced during the 106th \nCongress.  HR 1459 was introduced by Rep. J.D. Hayworth (R-AZ) and nine \noriginal co-sponsors from the Ways and Means Committee.\n\nHR 1459 contains four key provisions with tax code changes:  1) The tax-free \nsale or spin-off of transmission assets into an RTO is allowed, 2) Nuclear \ndecommissioning laws are adapted to a competitive market by allowing \ndeductions to a trust fund no longer subject to cost-of service ratemaking, \n3) The contributions in aid of construction (CIAC) tax on interconnections to \ntransmission and distribution facilities is eliminated, and 4) Private use \ntax rules are changed to permit open access to transmission and distribution \nfacilities.\n\nThe measure was referred to the House Ways and Means Committee, and EEI has \nurged Congress to act without delay in moving it forward.  Enactment will \nhelp encourage a vigorous but fair competitive environment, the Institute \nnoted.  The same legislation has been incorporated into S 389, Senate Energy \nCommittee Chairman Frank Murkowski's (R-AK) energy security bill, and \nstand-alone legislation could also be introduced.  Hearings are expected to \nbe held in both the Senate Finance and House Ways and Means Committees, \nprobably after consideration of President Bush's individual tax proposal.\n\nADMINISTRATION/FERC\n\nWhite House Seeks $2 Trillion Budget In Fiscal Year 2002***\n\nPresident Bush last week transmitted a $2 trillion fiscal year 2002 budget \nrequest to Capitol Hill.  The Administration noted that its proposal \nmoderates recent explosive growth in discretionary spending to four percent \nin 2002,* an increase of $26 billion over the preceding fiscal year.  The \nbudget bid contains a $231 billion total surplus in 2002, and projects a $5.6 \ntrillion surplus over the next ten years.\n\nIn the energy area, the Administration noted the federal government=02=07s \nlongstanding and evolving role* in the sector, pointing out that most \nfederal energy programs and agencies have no state or private counterparts.  \nIt proposed about $2.8 billion in discretionary spending for energy programs, \nand about $2.1 billion in tax benefits, *mainly to encourage development of \ntraditional and alternative energy sources.*  DOE=02=07s budget request was $19.2 \nbillion, including $2.3 billion for energy resources programs.  This later \nfigure represents a decrease of $196 million, or 7.9 percent, from fiscal \nyear 2001.\n\nIn the environmental sector, the Administration sought some $7.3 billion in \ndiscretionary funding for EPA, including a $3.7 billion operating program \nfocused on implementation of most federal pollution control laws.\n\nSuccess of Restructuring Tied to Energy Strategy, FERC=02=07s Massey Asserts***\n\nElectric restructuring may be in jeopardy, and its success *is in the hands \nof regulators and policymakers,* FERC Commissioner William Massey has \nasserted.  Speaking at a recent National Governors Association policy forum \nin Philadelphia, Commissioner Massey urged officials to pay attention to the \nkey elements of a national energy strategy.\n\nFirst, he specified, there is a need for an adequate supply of the energy \ncommodity.  Turning to a second element, Commissioner Massey told forum \nattendees that *all the supply in the world won=02=07t help unless it can be \ndelivered over an adequate, efficient, non-discriminatory network.*  \nCommissioner Massey identified market structure as the third essential \nelement of a national energy strategy, while citing an inherent difficulty: \nthat *good structure cannot be easily parsed between wholesale and retail \njurisdictions.*  Accordingly, he said, FERC and the states must work together \non market structure.\n\nThe final element of a successful energy strategy, the commissioner \nspecified, is the need for aggressive FERC intervention when markets fail to \ndo their job.  *If the states cannot depend on the wholesale market regulator \nto ensure reasonable prices for consumers,* he cautioned, they *will surely \nthink twice before heading down the restructuring path.*\n\nNEW GENERATION\n\nDynegy To Build Second Plant in Kentucky***\n\nDynegy has announced plans to construct a new 330 megawatt plant adjacent to \nthe Riverside Generating project in Lawrence County, Kentucky.  Dynegy will \nsell the power generated at the plant in the wholesale market.  Commercial \noperation is expected to begin first quarter of 2002.\n\nPPL To Expand Generation Capacity***\n\nPPL Corporation this week said it would build a 540 megawatt power plant near \nChicago and would increase the capacity of its Susquehanna nuclear plant by \n100 megawatts.  CEO William Hecht said the Illinois plant is expected to be \nin service by the summer of 2002.\n\nConstellation Energy Group Announces Eight New Plants***\n\nConstellation Energy Group  this week announced that the company is scheduled \nto bring four peaking power plants on line this summer.  Additionally, four \nlarger power plants are scheduled to enter service in the following two \nsummers. The four peaking plants are located in Illinois, Pennsylvania, \nVirginia and West Virginia.  The larger power plants are under construction \nin California, Florida, Illinois, and Texas.\n\nWe=02=07re building in these seven states because they serve regions where \nwholesale electricity is needed and where we can provide energy to support \nour national power marketing business,* said Constellation Energy Group \nChairman and CEO Christian Poindexter.\n\nCalifornia Energy Commission Approves Construction of Otay Mesa Generating \nPlant***\n\nPG&E Corporation=02=07s National Energy Group (NEG) last week announced that the \nCalifornia Energy Commission (CEC) has approved construction of the Otay Mesa \nGenerating Plant in San Diego County, which the NEG has developed.  The 500 \nmegawatt project will produce enough electricity to power about 1,000 homes.  \nAfter the development process is completed, Calpine Corporation will assume \nownership of the project and will construct and operate the plant.  NEG will \ncontract for up to half the plants output.\n\nENERGY DATA\n\nWeekly Electric Output (Week 15)***\n\nElectric output reached 63,528 GWh for the week ending April 14 (Week 15), \nwith the highest increase over 2000 levels in the South Central states, which \nboth had a 12.6 percent increase over 2000 for week 15.  Year-to-date, the \nRocky Mountain region experienced the greatest increase in output (7.6 \npercent) over 2000.

    "Body": "Gas OII Parties\n\nPer our discussion at the April 10 meeting to discuss draft tariffs to\nimplement the PG&E Gas OII settlement, PG&E is providing the following\nmaterials:\n\nRevised Gas OII and PG&E Tariff Preparation Schedule.  The testimony\nand hearing schedule adopted at the April 11 prehearing conference is now\nincluded, along with revised dates for the tariff approval process for\nPG&E's settlement.  Please remember that much of this schedule is\nspeculative - and highly dependent on the actual timing of Commission\nactions and presumes we can achieve broad consensus on tariff language. For\nPG&E's settlement tariffs, we have delayed our providing a next draft until\nMay 25.  We need the extra time to address the issues raised at the April 10\nmeeting, and to further explore our internal process requirements.  We\ntherefore delayed our next tariff meeting until June 27, which should be\nafter hearings and opening briefs on SoCal matters.  If the litigation\nschedule changes, we may need to revisit our tariff preparation schedule.\n\nList of Issues.  This list is compiled from the April 10 meeting,\nplus the April 6 CPAG meeting.  As we work through these issues, we may be\ncontacting individual parties to further discuss the issue before we send\nout our next tariff draft.  Please let us know if you have comments or\nadditions to this list.\n\nExhibit A to Attachment K to the CTA Request Form, proposed CTA bill\nformat.  A draft of this proposed bill format Exhibit has been completed\nsince we sent out the last package. The attached table is for your\ninformation on the source of various elements to be included in the bill\nformat, and would not be part of the final Exhibit.  If you have questions\nor comments on this Exhibit, please include Cathy Bretz on your E-mail\nclbe@pge.com) or call her at 415-973-3140.\n\nCore Rate Impacts of CTA Storage Unbundling.  An illustration of the\nexpected rate impacts of this program was completed since we sent out the\nlast package.  This illustration was presented at the CPAG and Tariff Review\nmeetings. If you have questions or comments on this attachment, please\ninclude Jerry Miller on your E-mail (grm8@pge.com) or call him at\n415-973-4104.\n\nWe also continue to welcome comments or concerns you may have on the draft\ntariffs for our Comprehensive Gas OII Settlement.  We will try to respond to\nthem in our next draft tariff package, to be sent May 25.\n\nThanks to those parties who attended the April 10 meeting and provided\nexcellent comments and suggestions.\n\nSincerely,\n\n\nRandy Litteneker\n\n\nAttachments\n\nOII + Tariff Schedule w6.doc>> <<April 10 GasOII Wrkshp Issues_.doc>>\nEXHIBIT A of ATTACHMENT K Sample Consolidated Bill Items cb2.doc>>\nIllustrative Rates_CTA unbundling.doc>>\n\nOII + Tariff Schedule w6.doc\nApril 10 GasOII Wrkshp Issues_.doc\nEXHIBIT A of ATTACHMENT K Sample Consolidated Bill Items cb2.doc\nIllustrative Rates_CTA unbundling.doc",
