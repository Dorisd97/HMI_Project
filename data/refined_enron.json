    "Body": "Jeff, thanks for the response.  Consider yourself a member of Project \nBoomerang.  I suggest that we try to talk sometime Monday and I can fill in \nsome of the detail on this effort.  I did hear that the lawsuit was filed \nunder Section 5 of AB1890.  Does that make any sense to you ?  I will call \nyou Monday morning to discuss the project and the role that you can play to \nhelp the effort.\n\nThanks\n\n\nFrank\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJeff Dasovich@EES on 04/14/2000 04:36:35 PM\nTo: Frank W Vickers/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc: Paul Kaufman@ECT \nSubject: Re: Project Boomerang  \n\nFrank:\n\nSorry I didn't get back to you sooner.  We're finalizing a deal to (among \nother things) have Socalgas unbundle its in-state transport, storage and \nbalancing, sell off the transport and storage rights in an open season and \ncreate a secondary market for each.  They will also permit trading of \nimbalances on their system.  The deal's getting finalized today.    (Paul, \nyour pal Joe Karp has joined the deal.)\n\nThe deal is currently scheduled to take effect beginning April 1, 2000.  \nStephanie Miller's been kept in the loop.  May be something that folks might \nwant include in due diligence w.r.t. to any gas contracts tied to the QFs.\n\nYour questions:\n\n1.  I am aware that the PUC just filed suit at FERC against El Paso for \nselling about 1.2 Bcf/day of gas capacity into California to Merchant Energy, \nbut hadn't heard about a suit regarding the QFs.  I will find out and let you \nknow.\n\n2.  Yes, I am in a position to follow the debate and keep you informed.  I'm \nassuming that your are up to speed on the debate as of today.  If not, let me \nknow and I and/or Paul can fill you in.\n\nIf there's anything else, don't hesitate to holler.  (415.782.7822).

In discussions \nwith Paul he suggested that I get you involved with the transaction.  Two \nthings come to immediate attention.\n\nI heard that the PUC has filed suit against El Paso relative to these 11 \nassets.  What do you know about this ?\nNOw that the CPUC is trying to implement terms of AB 1890's section 390 alot \nof questions and methods are surfacing about calculations of payments to \nQF's.  Are you in a postion to follow this debate and keep me informed during \nthe process ??\n\n\nThanks\n\nFrank\n\n503-464-3940",

Gray Davis demanded that power\ngenerators refund nearly $9 billion in electricity overcharges and\ncomplained that federal regulators have ``looked the other way\nwhile energy companies bilked our state.''\n    Davis told a Senate hearing Wednesday that the decision by the\nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission to curtail price spikes in\nCalifornia and 10 other Western states was a step forward.\n    ``But its actions do nothing about the overcharges'' over the\npast year, he said.\n    The governor, a Democrat, has been criticized by Republicans,\nwho charge he has allowed the California power crisis to get out of\nhand.\n    Davis defended his actions, saying the state has stepped up\napproval for new power plants and strengthened conservation\nprograms. He also said the state has little control over price\ngouging by out-of-state power generators.\n    ``The governor once said he could solve California's problems in\n15 minutes. ... But it appears that California has continued to try\nand hide the true cost of power by having the state pay for it\ninstead of the utilities,'' putting California taxpayers in\njeopardy, said Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska.\n    Murkowski said many of the alleged overcharges are by public\npower entities not under FERC jurisdiction\n    Sen. Joe Lieberman, D-Conn., chairman of the Governmental\nAffairs Committee, said the FERC, which regulates wholesale\nelectricity sales, has been slow to respond and ``surprisingly\nreluctant'' to assure that electricity prices are just and\nreasonable, as required by the 1934 Federal Power Act.\n    The agency's response to the Western power problem ``raises\nserious questions about whether (FERC) has or will oversee the\nnewly deregulated energy markets'' not only in the West but across\nthe rest of the country.\n    The federal agency, whose commissioners were to testify later in\nthe day, imposed limited, market-based price caps on Monday in\nCalifornia and 10 other Western states from Washington to Arizona.\nThe agency also ordered the parties to attend a conference next\nweek to try to work out agreements on overcharges and other issues.\n    Months ago, the FERC singled out $124 million in alleged\novercharges by power generators. The power companies have since\nchallenged the agency's findings and the matter remains in dispute.\n    ``To date not a single penny in refunds has been returned to\nCalifornia,'' complained Davis. He said that between May 2000 and\nthe beginning of this month power generators are believed to have\novercharged California $8.9 billion.\n    ``They must be required to give us back our money,'' said Davis.\n``It is unconscionable that FERC looked the other way while energy\ncompanies bilked our state for up to $9 billion.''\n    The state spent $7 billion for electricity in 1999 and $27\nbillion in 2000 and is projected to pay nearly $50 billion this\nyear, said Davis.\n    ``Power generators have been able to exert extreme power over\nour energy market,'' he said.\n    Davis rejected Republican criticism that the state is not\naddressing the problem. He said newly approved power plants will\nprovide 20,000 additional megawatts of electricity by 2003,\nincluding 4,000 megawatts by the end of this summer.\n    ``Everything that can be done to bring reliable, affordable\nenergy to California is being done ... except wholesale price\nrelief,'' he said.\n    ``This administration has minimized this crisis (for) more\nmonths,'' said Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., alluding to President\nBush's repeated refusal to urge the FERC to mitigate electricity\nprices. Bush has strongly opposed price controls, although he\nindicated support for FERC's limited price mitigation effort this\nweek.\n    Murray said the government should issue a disaster declaration\nso that businesses can get low-income loans, and require that FERC\npress its investigation into price gouging and demand refunds not\nonly in California but in the Pacific Northwest, where electricity\nprices have also skyrocketed.\n    Republicans continued their opposition to more stringent price\ncaps based on the cost of generation at individual power plants.\n    ``Having a federal agency try to determine what is a just and\nreasonable price is laughable,'' said Sen. Fred Thompson of\nTennessee, the committee's ranking Republican. Hard price caps\n``don't work when supply is the problem. ... They make a bad\nsituation worse,'' he said.\n    After FERC issued its limited price control order this week,\nSenate Democrats on Tuesday said they would drop legislation to\nrequire more stringent cost-based price caps on Western electricity\nsales.\n    Democrats in the House, however, said they would continue to\npursue a bill requiring the FERC to take more aggressive action.",

    "Body": "Borderline\nNo.  2001-22\nOctober 30, 2001<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = \"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office\" />\n\n \n\nNovember 1 Tariff Change\n\nTariff revisions detailing and addressing the use of an Operational Flow Order (OFO) on Northern Border, which were part of Northern Border's approved Park and Loan (PAL) filing, will become effective on November 1.   Here is a brief overview of the upcoming changes.\n\n \nPurpose of an OFO\n \nAn OFO will be used by Northern Border to 1) alleviate conditions that threaten the integrity of the system, 2) maintain pipeline operations at pressures required to provide efficient and reliable transportation service, 3) assure adequate system line pack, and 4) maintain service for all of Northern Border's firm shippers.   \n \nAn OFO will be treated as a tool of last resort.  Northern Border will first attempt to utilize its system, its services (transportation and PAL), and if necessary, assistance of interconnecting systems to alleviate operational problems before invoking its OFO tariff provisions.\n \n \nPosting of an OFO Watch\n \nIf resolution of an operational problem is unlikely, such as when a daily or cumulative OBA imbalance with an interconnected party is outside of a defined tolerance range, Northern Border will post an OFO watch.  Similar to a severe weather notice, the purpose of an OFO watch is to pre-alert shippers and interconnecting systems to a location or area on Northern Border's system in which underlying operational conditions could prompt the issuance of an OFO.\n \n\n\nOFO Issuance\n \nNorthern Border will issue an OFO if it is determined that an OFO watch has failed to serve as a catalyst for corrective action. \n \nA Northern Border OFO will be as localized as is reasonably possible.  Furthermore, each OFO will be tailored to match the severity of the known or anticipated problem being addressed.\n \n \nOFO Impact\n \nAn OFO can result in either the curtailment of interruptible services and/or the forced balancing of nominations and actual flows through the confirmation process.   \n \nIf service is reduced or interrupted due to an OFO, Northern Border will directly provide affected shippers, as soon as possible, a summary of the service interruption that will include the operational variables that prompted such action.  In addition, affected shippers will be notified of any imbalances that require immediate resolution.\n \nRoutine status updates will be posted throughout the period in which the OFO is in effect.\n \n \nFailure to Comply\n \nWhen an OFO is issued, it is the responsibility of the affected shippers to make a good faith effort to comply.  If such shippers fail to respond to the OFO, or their response is insufficient to correct the problem, Northern Border may take further action including the curtailment of firm service or the immediate cash out of cumulative imbalances that are in excess of 10% of the Historical Flow Quantity.\n \nNorthern Border will not be liable for any costs incurred by a shipper in complying with or be exposed to any damages that result from an interruption in service due to an OFO.\n \n \nImpact of OFO Tariff Changes on Interconnects\n \nFERC Order No. 637 requires that pipelines \"take all reasonable actions to minimize the issuance and adverse impact of Operational Flow Orders (OFOs).\"  Northern Border recognizes that maintaining daily and cumulative OBA imbalances with its interconnected parties within reasonable tolerances levels is critical in meeting such obligation across the grid.  Consequently, the November 1 tariff changes includes language which define what is an acceptable tolerance range on a Northern Border OBA imbalance.\n \nTo serve as a benchmark, Northern Border has already begun calculating a Historical Flow Quantity (HFQ) for each point of interconnection on Northern Border's system.  The HFQ is the lesser of the average daily scheduled quantity for the previous 15 consecutive Gas Days or the actual daily flow quantity for such time period.   \n \nOn November 1, the default cumulative OBA imbalance tolerance level for a given interconnect on Northern Border's system will be +/- 10% of the point's HFQ.   If such approach fails to meet the needs of an interconnected party, Northern Border's tariff does permit the use of an alternative tolerance level at a given point of interconnect as long as it has been mutually agreed to both OBA parties.\n \nFurthermore, the daily OBA swings at interconnects on Northern Border that are on pressure control will also be monitored more closely; the default daily OBA imbalance tolerance level will be +/- 5% of the daily scheduled quantity.  Once again, Northern Border's tariff does permit deviation from this \"standardized\" daily tolerance if an alternative method is mutually acceptable to the OBA parties. \n \nFor those who would like to initiate discussions on establishing OBA imbalance tolerance levels with Northern Border that deviate from the defaults described above, please contact Scott Coburn at (402) 398.7760.",

Enron et al were concerned that the RTO initiatives underway \nwere independently developing RTOs with little emphasis on coordination with \nneighboring business practices.  \n\nAt the May 30, 2001 FERC meeting, Chairman Hebert announced this FERC \ntechnical conference may be scheduled as early as June.  This is a reversal \nof the Chairman's earlier resistance to holding a technical conference when \nhe instead favored the RTO filing process to individually address \ninterregional coordination.\n\nThe key to the Chairman's change in direction can be attributed to Enron's \nactive participation on the Electronic Scheduling Collaborative (ESC) a \nnon-NERC industry collaborative effort formed to respond to the FERC ANOPR on \nOASIS Phase II.  \n\nBy working through a EPSA/ELCON joint filing in response to the ESC filing, \nEnron was able to raise awareness of the seams coordination threats to OASIS \nPhase II development and successfully sway the ESC to file in support of the \nearlier EPSA/ELCON/Enron/Reliant/Dynegy Request for Technical Conference. \n\nGovt Affairs will continue to monitor the development of the Technical \nConference and provide needed support to resolve inter-RTO seams issues.\n\nCharles Yeung\nGovt Affairs NA\n713-853-0348",

Items of \ninterest:\n\nThird party studies may be used upon mutual agreement between SPP and \nCustomer; however, SPP is not required to allow a third party contractor in \nany instance that it cannot meet the time frames for study completion.\nThe current queued customer will bear the costs of completing a new study if \nsomeone in the queue before it withdraws.  (Dynegy asked that the withdrawing \ncustomer should pay for any new studies required by others.)\nWhile SPP is required to provide notice if the study will take more than 60 \ndays, it is not bound to complete a study in 60 days (if more time is \nreasonably needed.)\nIf transmission is not purchased, the customer is responsible for the costs \nof upgrades that are needed \"but for\" the interconnection.  However, once \ntransmission is requested, SPP is limited to charging the higher of (i) the \nnetwork upgrade expansion cost or (ii) an embedded cost rate which has the \nexpansion cost rolled-in.  This is similar to pricing on pipelines.  \nTypically, Enron would not want to pay for network upgrades (as opposed to \nthe interconnection alone costs) without obtaining the transmission right on \nOASIS.  This order does advance the argument that network upgrades which \nbenefit the system (other customers) should be paid for in rates to all \ncustomers.\n\nLet me know if you would like a copy of the order.",

    "Body": "Today, we announced plans to merge with Dynegy, a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties.  Dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own.  We believe merging with Dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you've worked so hard to build.  Following are the major components of the transaction.\n\nDeal Terms\n\n--\tThe transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of 0.2685 Dynegy shares for every Enron share.  For example, each 1,000 shares of Enron stock will be converted to 268 shares of Dynegy upon closing, plus cash for fractional shares, upon closing.\n--\tChevronTexaco owns approximately 26 percent of Dynegy's outstanding common stock.  ChevronTexaco will invest $1.5 billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional $1 billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger.  Dynegy will immediately invest $1.5 billion in cash in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas.\n--   Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares.\n--   The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close late next year.\n\nEnron will have immediate access to Dynegy's $1.5 billion cash investment in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary.\n\nManagement of Newly Formed Company\n\nChuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company, which will be called Dynegy Inc., and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO.\n\nI will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes.  I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Greg Whalley will continue to serve as president and COO of Enron until the transaction closes.  Then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Mark Frevert will continue as vice chairman of Enron.\n\nManagement from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth, efficient integration.  The make-up of the integration team has not yet been determined.\n\nThe merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2002.  This merger will create an enormous growth engine, providing great opportunities for our employees, shareholders and customers.  As with any merger, some elimination of positions is almost inevitable, and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company.  We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions.  Clearly, we cannot rule out involuntary separation, but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations.  I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible.\n\nAs I said in my video, this is a day like no other in our company's history.  We considered several options, but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses.\n\nI know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps.  We have a list of frequently asked questions posted at <http://home.enron.com/updates/>.  If you have additional questions, please submit them to questions@enron.com <mailto:questions@enron.com>.  We will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions.  If you receive any calls from the media, please refer them to our media team at (713) 853-5670.\n\nI ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company.  Rather than closing doors, we are opening new ones, as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise, including our market reach, financial strength and industry experience.  Together, we will be a new merchant powerhouse.\n\nAnd again, thank you for everything you have done for Enron.\n\n\nInvestors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint proxy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes available, because it will contain important information.  Investors and security holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospectus (when it is available) and other documents containing information about Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov.  Copies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus and the SEC filings that will be incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement/prospectus may also be obtained for free by directing a request to either:  Investor Relations, Dynegy Inc., 1000 Louisiana, Suite 5800, Houston, TX 77002, Phone:  (713) 507-6400, Fax:  (713) 507-6808; or Investor Relations, Enron Corp., 1400 Smith Street, Houston, TX 77002, Phone:  (713) 853-3956, Fax:  (713) 646-3002.\n\nIn addition, the identity of the persons who, under SEC rules, may be considered \"participants in the solicitation\" of Dynegy and Enron shareholders in connection with the proposed transactions, and any description of their direct or indirect interests, by security holdings or otherwise, are available in an SEC filing under Schedule 14A made by each of Dynegy and Enron.",

    "Body": "Several thoughts from federal reg./transmission side:\nI haven't worked with a VEPCO interconnection agreement yet, but many times \nthere are requirements that the generator is required to provide emergency \npower to the interconnected transmission provider, in which case you would \nwant the interconnection agreement to cover all costs you would incur to \nreplace the energy at a different location (usually it is difficult to get \nthis agreement, so you should check and then factor that into the equation).  \nI would be happy to look at the interconnection agreement with you.\nInterconnection of generation is a separate process from requesting \ntransmission.  It appears that VEPCO has to buy the transmission (or use its \nnetwork transmission) when the Delivery Point is the plant.  Enron will have \nto purchase transmission on VEPCO if it is selling to third parties off the \nplant and will have to purchase transmission on other systems if it wants to \nsupply at an alternate delivery point.  Please discuss this with Kevin \nPresto's tranmission people (Bill Rust on 31).  Enron cannot use VEPCO's \nnetwork transmission to delivery to third parties.\nIs this plant in the VEPCO queue yet?  Also, FERC has issued some recent \nrulings that deal with time limits on system impact studies, etc.  While \nVEPCO is probably incentivized to get this built, you want to make sure that \nyou do not lose optionality in selling to third parties from the plant due to \ntransmission constraints.  A request for transmission on OASIS is the only \nway to ensure deliverability to third parties.\n3.5 (c) Intra-day scheduling--You may have hourly transmission risk for an \nincrease.  Unless you buy longer term firm, you will deliver from other \nsources using hourly non-firm, which is the lowest priority of transmission \nand subject to getting cut.  You may want to consider doing this on \nbest/reasonable efforts basis.  (Also, even if you purchase \ndaily/monthly/yearly firm to serve third parties, if you change the point of \nreceipt or point of delivery temporarily, your request is treated as \nnon-firm.)\n12.4--Currently VEPCO is interested in joining the Alliance ISO (an RTO that \nhas not been approved by FERC yet--competing ISO to Midwest ISO), but since \nFERC has not approved any RTO for VEPCO yet, there could be significant \nchanges in the transmission charges/methods of obtaining \ntransmission/grandfathering of current transmission, etc during this \ncontract.  Make sure with the ENA attorneys that this out/increase in price \ncovers that circumstance.\nUnderlying tranmission rates on VEPCO or any other provider can change at \nmost any time, subject to the provider filing a rate case.  Therefore, any \ncurrent transmission rates shown on OASIS are not necessarily what you will \npay over the term of any transmission that Enron may purchase to serve this \ncontract.  Generally, transmission providers will not agree to fixed rates.\n\n\n\n\n\nTom Chapman\n06/13/2000 06:07 PM\nTo: Christi L Nicolay/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc:  \nSubject: VEPCO PPA\n\nChristi--\n\nThis is the note that I received on Tuesday June 13.  This is a relatively \nearly draft of the PPA.\n\nI think that we still have to purchase the land associated with the sites and \ndo the due diligence on the site with regards to some of the siting issues.  \nIN addition, in NC we are going to get a CPCN to site the plant to speed up \nthe regulatory process in the NCUC.  I think that this will make the issue \nless contentious because of the NCUC's acceptance of the Dynegy plant at \nRockingham that had a PPA with Duke Power.  \n\nUsing the Dynegy plant as a guideline, their only stumbling block was their \ngas agreeement.  They built a bypass off Transco.  We would be taking gas \nfrom the LDC of Rocky Mount.  Having talked with the regulatory folks at the \nNCUC who handle gas issues, this is the preferred route.  So, I do not think \nthat we have any major state issues.  I think that right now we are simply \nworking on some of the siting issues.\n\nThat being said, I will let you take a look at the PPA and let me know or \nJeff Keenan (or even Heather Kroll or Ozzie Pagan) if you think that there \nare some transmission issues or other issues on the federal level.  \n\nThanks.\n\nTom\n---------------------- Forwarded by Tom Chapman/HOU/ECT on 06/13/2000 06:04 \nPM ---------------------------\n\n\nLinda J Simmons\n06/13/2000 08:45 AM\nTo: Kay Mann/Corp/Enron@Enron, Heather Kroll/HOU/ECT@ECT, Ozzie \nPagan/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jeffrey M Keenan/HOU/ECT@ECT, Tom Chapman/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc:  \nSubject: VEPCO PPA\n\n\n----- Forwarded by Linda J Simmons/HOU/ECT on 06/13/2000 08:44 AM -----\n\n\t\"Nancy Wodka\" <nwodka@bracepatt.com>\n\t06/12/2000 04:20 PM\n\t\t \n\t\t To: <linda.j.simmons@enron.com>, <lisa.mellencamp@enron.com>\n\t\t cc: \"William Frederking\" <wfrederking@bracepatt.com>\n\t\t Subject: VEPCO PPA\n\n\nLisa:  Attached is a draft of the Power Purchase Agreement with VEPCO, based \non the current version of the term sheet.  In preparing the draft, we did \nencounter several additional questions for Enron's consideration.  These are \nnoted with brackets and, in some cases, italicized notes, in the draft and \nare also highlighted below.  You may want to address these issues before this \ngoes to VEPCO.\n\nCover and first page-- Should the party to the agreement (for the moment) be \nENA or a special purpose company?\n\nDefinitions--  We included a defined term \"Emergency Start-Up\" (a start up or \nincrease in energy scheduled during a day) and a place in Exhibit A to \ninclude a price for this, although this was not covered in the term sheet.\n\nSection 2.2--  We included a provision for VEPCO to take test energy (energy \ncharge only; no demand charge)--do you want this?\n\nSection 2.3--  This was taken from the term sheet, but is it correct that COD \nwill be July 1 (since the demand charge is supposed to start June 1?)  Also, \nit would be best to define \"commencement of construction\" to avoid \ncontroversy down the road.  We could either do this now or put in a \nplaceholder that indicates it needs to be defined or be silent, whichever is \nyour preference.  Also, bear in mind that we have not included a specific \nremedy (e.g., liquidated damages) if the Seller does not achieve that \nmilestone on time.  Under the default provision (Section 8.1(c)), there would \nbe a 30 day period to cure before Buyer could terminate (extendible to 90 \ndays if a longer period of time is needed and Seller diligently pursues the \ncure).  Would you prefer the right to pay ld's and extend the time period?\n\nSection 3.1(b)--  Should the 1400 hour limitation apply to all sales under \nthis PPA or only sales from the Facility?  I.e., would you use this Agreement \nto sell to VEPCO power in addition to what would be available from the \nFacility?  Also, is this a calendar year limitation--i.e., could they take \n1400 hours in the period June-Dec. 2001 or does the 1400 hours need to be \npro-rated for the first year?\n\nSection 3.4-- Since this is not a base load plant, the normal definition of \nAvailability as the number of hours in a year of operations compared to the \ntotal hours in the year would not seem to be applicable.  Instead, we stated \nthat the Facility would be capable of being available 92% of the year (other \nthan due to Force Majeure and 336 hours (2 weeks) of scheduled \nmaintenance)--i.e., that if they tried to schedule it, it is expected to be \navailable.  Is that what Enron intended?  Additionally, the term sheet stated \nthat a remedy for failure to meet Availability would need to be agreed--why \nwouldn't cost of cover damages be appropriate? Also, please note that we \nincluded language stating that Seller will not perform maintenance during \npeak periods.\n\nSection 3.5(b)-- Please note the bracketed language re taking Blocks of \nEnergy.  We have 50 MW minimum blocks but the capacity is 223--should we \nallow the last Block to be 23 if they've scheduled all the rest?\n\nSection 3.5(c)-- Please see the bracketed language at the end of this Section.\n\nSection 4.7-- Should there a required minimum take of Energy?\n\nArticle 6-- The Genco/Santee Cooper form of PPA we used as a model did not \nhave any provisions on metering.  (See placeholder note in Article 6.)  Do \nyou want to add such a provision, ignore it or just include a placeholder for \nnow?\n\nSection 9.1-- Is 30 days from invoice correct for the payment due date or \nwould you prefer a shorter period?\n\nArticle 15-- The Genco/Santee Cooper form had mediation as a required step \nprior to arbitration.  Should we keep that?  Also, the form of arbitration is \n\"baseball\" arbitration--i.e.,  the arbitrators have to chose one party's \nposition or the other's.  Is that what you want?\n\nSection 16.2--  We used New York for governing law, on the premise that it \nwill be difficult to get VEPCO to agree to Texas law and we would not \nrecommend Virginia law for this contract.\n\nExhibit A-- There are a number of questions on the pricing exhibit--please \nsee the bracketed notes therein.\n\nPlease call and let us know how you would like to proceed on this draft.\n\n - VEPPPA.DOC",

    "Body": "Dear Generation/Power Marketing Executive:\n\nThe following is this week's Alliance Express newsletter, and a special=20\nannouncement regarding a proposed action by the Financial Accounting=20\nStandards Board (FASB).\n\nFASB 133\nFASB is considering an exception to Statement of Financial Accounting=20\nStandards (SFAS) No. 133 that will exempt energy companies from the=20\nrequirement to account for capacity contracts as derivatives.  A vote again=\nst=20\nthe exception would result in a significant increase in earnings volatility=\n,=20\nand raises other important concerns for energy suppliers.  (Attached is a=\n=20\nsummary of this issue.)  The Board is expected to vote on this issue during=\n=20\nMay 2001.  EEI will be taking steps to appraise FASB of our concerns.

The bill would repeal PUHCA an=\nd=20\ntransfer oversight of public utility holding companies from the Securities=\n=20\nand Exchange Commission to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and=20\nappropriate state agencies.\nS.206 was approved with two amendments.  Offered by Sen. Mike Enzi (R-WY),=\n=20\nthe first amendment would establish the Electric Energy Market Competition=\n=20\nTask Force to study competition in the wholesale and retail market for=20\nelectric energy in the United States. The task force would be made up of=20\nrepresentatives of FERC, the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade=20\nCommission, as well as non-voting representatives from the Department of=20\nAgriculture and the Securities and Exchange Commission. The amendment also=\n=20\ncontained a provision, co-sponsored by Sen.

The bill (HR 1459) contains the same provisions as were in a=20\nmeasure (HR 4971), with technical corrections, introduced during the 106th=\n=20\nCongress.  HR 1459 was introduced by Rep. J.D. Hayworth (R-AZ) and nine=20\noriginal co-sponsors from the Ways and Means Committee.\n\nHR 1459 contains four key provisions with tax code changes:  1) The tax-fre=\ne=20\nsale or spin-off of transmission assets into an RTO is allowed, 2) Nuclear=\n=20\ndecommissioning laws are adapted to a competitive market by allowing=20\ndeductions to a trust fund no longer subject to cost-of service ratemaking,=\n=20\n3) The contributions in aid of construction (CIAC) tax on interconnections =\nto=20\ntransmission and distribution facilities is eliminated, and 4) Private use=\n=20\ntax rules are changed to permit open access to transmission and distributio=\nn=20\nfacilities.\n\nThe measure was referred to the House Ways and Means Committee, and EEI has=\n=20\nurged Congress to act without delay in moving it forward.  Enactment will=\n=20\nhelp encourage a vigorous but fair competitive environment, the Institute=\n=20\nnoted.  The same legislation has been incorporated into S 389, Senate Energ=\ny=20\nCommittee Chairman Frank Murkowski's (R-AK) energy security bill, and=20\nstand-alone legislation could also be introduced.  Hearings are expected to=\n=20\nbe held in both the Senate Finance and House Ways and Means Committees,=20\nprobably after consideration of President Bush's individual tax proposal.\n\n ADMINISTRATION/FERC\n\n***White House Seeks $2 Trillion Budget In Fiscal Year 2002***\n\nPresident Bush last week transmitted a $2 trillion fiscal year 2002 budget=\n=20\nrequest to Capitol Hill.  The Administration noted that its proposal=20\n*moderates recent explosive growth in discretionary spending to four percen=\nt=20\nin 2002,* an increase of $26 billion over the preceding fiscal year.  The=\n=20\nbudget bid contains a $231 billion total surplus in 2002, and projects a $5=\n.6=20\ntrillion surplus over the next ten years.\n\nIn the energy area, the Administration noted the federal government=02=07s=\n=20\n*longstanding and evolving role* in the sector, pointing out that most=20\nfederal energy programs and agencies have no state or private counterparts.=\n =20\nIt proposed about $2.8 billion in discretionary spending for energy program=\ns,=20\nand about $2.1 billion in tax benefits, *mainly to encourage development of=\n=20\ntraditional and alternative energy sources.*  DOE=02=07s budget request was=\n $19.2=20\nbillion, including $2.3 billion for energy resources programs.  This later=\n=20\nfigure represents a decrease of $196 million, or 7.9 percent, from fiscal=\n=20\nyear 2001.\n\nIn the environmental sector, the Administration sought some $7.3 billion in=\n=20\ndiscretionary funding for EPA, including a $3.7 billion operating program=\n=20\nfocused on implementation of most federal pollution control laws.\n\n ***Success of Restructuring Tied to Energy Strategy, FERC=02=07s Massey As=\nserts***\n\nElectric restructuring may be in jeopardy, and its success *is in the hands=\n=20\nof regulators and policymakers,* FERC Commissioner William Massey has=20\nasserted.  Speaking at a recent National Governors Association policy forum=\n=20\nin Philadelphia, Commissioner Massey urged officials to pay attention to th=\ne=20\nkey elements of a national energy strategy.\n\nFirst, he specified, there is a need for an adequate supply of the energy=\n=20\ncommodity.  Turning to a second element, Commissioner Massey told forum=20\nattendees that *all the supply in the world won=02=07t help unless it can b=\ne=20\ndelivered over an adequate, efficient, non-discriminatory network.* =20\nCommissioner Massey identified market structure as the third essential=20\nelement of a national energy strategy, while citing an inherent difficulty:=\n=20\nthat *good structure cannot be easily parsed between wholesale and retail=\n=20\njurisdictions.*  Accordingly, he said, FERC and the states must work togeth=\ner=20\non market structure.\n\nThe final element of a successful energy strategy, the commissioner=20\nspecified, is the need for aggressive FERC intervention when markets fail t=\no=20\ndo their job.  *If the states cannot depend on the wholesale market regulat=\nor=20\nto ensure reasonable prices for consumers,* he cautioned, they *will surely=\n=20\nthink twice before heading down the restructuring path.*\n\nNEW GENERATION\n\n***Dynegy To Build Second Plant in Kentucky***\n\nDynegy has announced plans to construct a new 330 megawatt plant adjacent t=\no=20\nthe Riverside Generating project in Lawrence County, Kentucky.

    "Body": "Gas OII Parties\n\nPer our discussion at the April 10 meeting to discuss draft tariffs to\nimplement the PG&E Gas OII settlement, PG&E is providing the following\nmaterials:\n\n* Revised Gas OII and PG&E Tariff Preparation Schedule.  The testimony\nand hearing schedule adopted at the April 11 prehearing conference is now\nincluded, along with revised dates for the tariff approval process for\nPG&E's settlement.  Please remember that much of this schedule is\nspeculative - and highly dependent on the actual timing of Commission\nactions and presumes we can achieve broad consensus on tariff language. For\nPG&E's settlement tariffs, we have delayed our providing a next draft until\nMay 25.  We need the extra time to address the issues raised at the April 10\nmeeting, and to further explore our internal process requirements.  We\ntherefore delayed our next tariff meeting until June 27, which should be\nafter hearings and opening briefs on SoCal matters.  If the litigation\nschedule changes, we may need to revisit our tariff preparation schedule.\n\n* List of Issues.  This list is compiled from the April 10 meeting,\nplus the April 6 CPAG meeting.  As we work through these issues, we may be\ncontacting individual parties to further discuss the issue before we send\nout our next tariff draft.  Please let us know if you have comments or\nadditions to this list.\n\n* Exhibit A to Attachment K to the CTA Request Form, proposed CTA bill\nformat.  A draft of this proposed bill format Exhibit has been completed\nsince we sent out the last package. The attached table is for your\ninformation on the source of various elements to be included in the bill\nformat, and would not be part of the final Exhibit.  If you have questions\nor comments on this Exhibit, please include Cathy Bretz on your E-mail\n(clbe@pge.com) or call her at 415-973-3140.\n\n* Core Rate Impacts of CTA Storage Unbundling.  An illustration of the\nexpected rate impacts of this program was completed since we sent out the\nlast package.  This illustration was presented at the CPAG and Tariff Review\nmeetings. If you have questions or comments on this attachment, please\ninclude Jerry Miller on your E-mail (grm8@pge.com) or call him at\n415-973-4104.\n\nWe also continue to welcome comments or concerns you may have on the draft\ntariffs for our Comprehensive Gas OII Settlement.  We will try to respond to\nthem in our next draft tariff package, to be sent May 25.\n\nThanks to those parties who attended the April 10 meeting and provided\nexcellent comments and suggestions.\n\nSincerely,\n\n\nRandy Litteneker\n\n\nAttachments\n\n <<OII + Tariff Schedule w6.doc>>     <<April 10 GasOII Wrkshp Issues_.doc>>\n <<EXHIBIT A of ATTACHMENT K Sample Consolidated Bill Items cb2.doc>>\n<<Illustrative Rates_CTA unbundling.doc>>\n\n - OII + Tariff Schedule w6.doc\n - April 10 GasOII Wrkshp Issues_.doc\n - EXHIBIT A of ATTACHMENT K Sample Consolidated Bill Items cb2.doc\n - Illustrative Rates_CTA unbundling.doc",

Cambridge, Mass.-based Off Wall Street, led by analyst Mark Robe=\nrts, thinks Enron's 2001 earnings will fall 6 cents short of the consensus =\nestimate of $1.79. The firm also believes Enron stock should trade around $=\n30, nearly 50% below Wednesday's $59.20.  The firm's 26-page report, publis=\nhed May 6, highlights Enron's declining profitability and increasing levera=\nge and suggests that the company should trade on the same sort of multiple =\nas a trading firm like Goldman Sachs (GS :NYSE - news ), which has a 2001 p=\nrice-to-earnings ratio about half of Enron's 33 times. OWS also alleges tha=\nt Enron's earnings quality is poor and that key parts of its financial stat=\nements are confusing and opaque.  Houston-based Enron didn't comment by pub=\nlication time on elements of the report that Detox  sent the company. An en=\nergy analyst who is bullish on Enron's outlook says the OWS report contains=\n fundamental misunderstandings about the energy market and Enron's business=\n model, but he says the report does include some ground-breaking and valid =\ninsights. (The analyst's firm doesn't give stock recommendations.)  Economi=\nes of Scale Why care what Off Wall Street writes, compared with, say, analy=\nsts at Merrill Lynch (MER :NYSE - news )? For one, OWS has an excellent tra=\nck record. Particularly sweet was 2000, when the tech stocks it had bashed =\ncame crashing down. It has also shown itself to be well ahead of the curve,=\n recommending that clients sell e-tailer priceline.com (PCLN :Nasdaq - news=\n ) in June 1999, when faith in Internet stocks was at its blindest and thei=\nr prices at their most insane.      Pulling Back Enron retreats after long =\nrally   Enron, with its domination of a burgeoning energy market, annual re=\nvenue of over $100 billion and impressive earnings growth, can hardly be ra=\nnked alongside the likes of priceline. But OWS thinks Enron is set for a pr=\necipitous drop nonetheless. Why?  OWS's main beef is that key profitability=\n measures are in decline. Margins on Enron's pretax operating earnings (whi=\nch the company's earnings releases call IBIT, or income before interest, ta=\nxes and other items) are falling. Total IBIT of $795 million in the first q=\nuarter amounted to only 1.59% of the $50 billion in revenue for the period,=\n compared with a 2.08% margin in the fourth quarter and 4.75% in the year-e=\narlier period. Revenue in the first quarter was nearly quadrupled from the =\nyear-earlier period, yet IBIT rose only 27%. This shrinkage is due to lower=\n-margin trading income making up an increasingly large share of Enron's rev=\nenue base.  OWS thus calculates that for the remainder of 2001 Enron needs =\nto generate an extra $2.1 billion in revenue for each additional penny it m=\nakes over its 2000 EPS of $1.47 to reach analysts' expectation of $1.79.  T=\nhe energy analyst counters that OWS apparently hasn't grasped how Enron can=\n continue to increase earnings even when margins shrink. It does so simply =\nby increasing volumes as the energy market balloons in size. In other words=\n, margins may decline, but since revenues are so much higher, earnings stil=\nl go up. Illustrating this, first-quarter 2001 EPS of 49 cents was 23% ahea=\nd of the year-ago figure, even though the IBIT margin shrank by 3.2 percent=\nage points. The analyst thinks Enron will make $1.82 per share in 2001.  Gr=\nowing On You In addition, the huge growth in the energy market that has so =\nhelped Enron is likely to continue for several years, according to the anal=\nyst. He notes that roughly 75% of the electricity available in the U.S. sti=\nll isn't traded in a market. \"Eventually it will be part of a competitive e=\nnvironment, but it'll take five to 10 years,\" says the analyst. And he beli=\neves the extreme volatility in energy-related commodities that has also ben=\nefited Enron will exist for longer than OWS projects.  Still, OWS's point o=\nn profitability is bolstered by other profit measures. Return on capital (n=\net income as a percentage of equity plus debt) was 6.6% in 2000, down on 19=\n99's 6.9% and well below the 2000 returns on capital at Duke (DUK :NYSE - n=\news ) (11.8%), Dynegy (DYN :NYSE - news ) (12.1%) and even Goldman (8.9%). =\n Even Enron bulls will admit that its financials are hard to follow. For ex=\nample, it doesn't give a gross margin number for its wholesale services, or=\n trading, business, which accounts for 96% of revenue. But one area of the =\ncompany's financial statements registered with the Securities and Exchange =\nCommission that consistently bugs analysts is the part that describes Enron=\n's related party transactions, which are the deals it does with entities th=\nat have some sort of link to the firm. In fact, one of the related entities=\n that Enron has traded with is headed by Enron's CFO, Andrew Fastow. The en=\nergy analyst comments: \"Why are they doing this? It's just inappropriate.\" =\n The reason for maintaining these hard-to-follow related party deals has be=\nen a source of speculation. But OWS analysis shows how a sales of optical f=\niber to a related party may have been used to goose earnings in the second =\nquarter of 2000. Estimated profits from the so-called dark fiber (optical c=\nable without the gear to send data over it) transaction allowed Enron to be=\nat analysts' second-earnings earnings estimate by 2 cents a share, rather t=\nhan missing by 2 cents.

    "Body": "Dear Potential Gas Supplier\n\nAs some of you may know our authority to buy gas off our existing spot agreement\nwill come to an end on December 31, 2001.  While we will honor current\ncommitments for gas to be delivered after that date, but we will not be able to\nuse the spot agreement to buy any more gas.  The reason that this is happening\nis that our City Attorney has interpreted the new City Charter as not allowing\ndelegations of authority such as employed in the way we buy gas now.\n\nWe are seeking approval for an ordinance which must be approved by the City\nCouncil that will restore our former ability to buy gas with the kind of\nagreement most gas suppliers are familiar.  We have the ordinance approved by\nthe City Attorney and it will shortly be in the pipeline for approval by our\nBoard and the City Council, but until then, this contract is a stop gap to keep\nus operating.\n\nI've attached the new contract and a cover letter which explains what we are\ndoing.  The deadline is November 8, 2001 at 4:00 PM.  We will take the executed\ncontracts to our Board with the counterparties listed on a Board Resolution and,\nif it is approved, we will be allowed to buy gas from this group after the new\nyear begins.  This is not the ideal contract but one we feel our Board will be\ncomfortable with until we can get around the Charter problem.  I can't make any\nchanges to this contract.  There is a notice published in the LA Times about the\navailability of the contract but I am sending it to you directly as someone we\nhave already done business with (and undoubtedly have satisfied all our\nboilerplate requirements) and will probably be interested in what we are trying\nto do here.\n\nI Hope most of you will respond.  Thanks\n\n(See attached file: Spot Gas Cover Letter.doc)(See attached file: New Spot Gas\nContract.doc)\n\n - Spot Gas Cover Letter.doc \n - New Spot Gas Contract.doc",

As our Board's new Special Committee continues its review of various matters, we will continue to cooperate fully with the SEC in its investigation, and we will continue to respond to investor requests so that they can evaluate, appreciate and appropriately value the strength of our core businesses.  \n\nRestatement of Earnings\n\nBased on information that we have recently obtained, Enron and its auditors determined that certain off-balance sheet entities should have been included in Enron's consolidated financial statements pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles.  As a result, Enron will restate its financial statements from 1997 to 2000 and for the first and second quarters of 2001.  These restatements have no material effect on Enron's current financial position.  Here are some details included in the filing:\n\nNet income for each period will be impacted by the retroactive consolidation of Joint Energy Development Investments (JEDI) and Chewco beginning in November 1997, the consolidation of an LJM1 subsidiary for 1999 and 2000 and prior year proposed audit adjustments.  Enron's current assessment indicates that the restatement will include:\n\n\t-- a reduction of approximately $96 million in 1997\n\t-- a reduction of approximately $113 million in 1998\n\t-- a reduction of approximately $250 million in 1999 \n\t-- a reduction of approximately $132 million in 2000\n\t-- an increase of approximately $17 million for the first quarter of 2001 \n\t-- an increase of approximately $5 million for the second quarter of 2001\n\t-- a reduction of $17 million for the third quarter of 2001.  \n\nThe consolidation of JEDI and Chewco also will increase Enron's debt by approximately $711 million in 1997, $561 million in 1998, $685 million in 1999 and $628 million in 2000.\n\nThe restatement will have no material impact on Enron's reported earnings for the nine-month period ending September 2001.\n\nYou can obtain more detailed information on the items described above by accessing the Form 8-K filing at <http://www.enron.com/corp/sec/>.\n\nWe will continue to review our strategic, operational and financial position, and we will continue to keep you updated on any developments.",

    "Body": "Here are my notes from today's call.  As with Monday, I've focused on getting them out as quickly as possible rather than taking extra time to re-organize them by subject.\n\nEnron's business has been grouped into three buckets:  Core, Non-core, and Under Review.  \nCore:  Wholesale energy business in North America and Europe, retail energy, pipelines\nNon-core:  Broadband, water, and international assets (i.e. EGAS).  Enron has approx. $8Bn in investments in these assets, and they have produced 'dismal' returns.  Enron will be exiting these businesses and will attempt to wind them up in an orderly fashion.  An aggressive divestiture program has been set in motion for these assets.  \nUnder Review:  EGM, EIM.  These businesses are being closely examined to determine whether they have a reasonable chance of long-term viability.  Required resource levels are being carefully studied.  Following review, Enron will move the different portions of these businesses to core or non-core as the analysis dictates.  \nApproximately $800MM of asset sales are under contract and expected to close in the fourth quarter.  These include a gas LDC in Brazil, EcoElectrica, and our Indian E&P assets.  \nEnron is in active pursuit of an additional private equity infusion of $500MM-1Bn.  Given the current environment, raising equity in the public markets would be 'inefficient', McMahon says.\nShort-term liquidity is provided by the $3Bn of credit drawn upon a few weeks ago, the $1Bn of new debt, and the $1.5Bn equity infusion from Dynegy.  Longer-term, the proceeds from the sale of PGE will provide liquidity.  Asset sales over the next year will be used to pay down debt.\nMcMahon described the major off-balance-sheet vehicles:\nMarlin was set up to hold Azurix assets.  It was initially capitalized with $950MM of 144a debt and $125MM of equity (raised from Enron and institutional investors).  The debt is supported by the equity and by Azurix' assets.  Enron is obligated to cover any deficit at the time the debt becomes due on 3/17/03 (the 'Enron topup' obligation).  The 3/17/03 date is accelerated in the event that Enron is rated below-investment-grade by any one of the three major agencies.  The primary asset of Marlin is Wessex Water.  As long as Wessex is worth at least $2.6Bn, there will be no Enron topup required.  If we take a 25% haircut to present book value, Enron will have to provide $650MM in consideration upon retirement of the debt.  This $650MM would hit Enron cash, income, and equity balances.  \nOsprey contains energy-related assets and 'other assets'.  It was initially capitalized with $2.4Bn of 144a debt and $220MM in equity (ENE and institutionals).  As with Marlin, the entity is an asset-backed structure with an Enron topup guarantee. The debt is supported by a) the assets; b) $1Bn of convertible preferred ENE (convertible into 50MM shares of ENE common); and c) additional ENE common as needed for topup.  Assuming the same 25% hypothetical haircut to current book value, Enron would have to deliver approx. $600MM of topup funds--which would hit ENE cash, income, and equity.  The debt must be retired by 9/17/02, with the same cut-to-junk early trigger provision as Marlin.  \nYosemite and the Credit-Linked Notes are predominantly commodity transactions entered into with 'large financial institutions'.  The underlying transactions are already on Enron's balance sheet.  McMahon says that there is no Enron share obligation related to these instruments.\nDynegy has reviewed all of these vehicles, McMahon says.\nOur 10Q will be filed five days late.  The 10Q will include all of this detail regarding the off-balance-sheet vehicles.\nThe special committee investigation is still ongoing.  The committee meets 2-3 times/week, sometimes more often.  The outside auditors (D&T) and external counsel hired by the committee are working 'virtually 7 days a week'.  Lay estimates that it will take the committee several more weeks to complete its investigation.\nMcMahon says it's 'way too early to tell' if any asset writedowns are called for.  That analysis is underway, but it will not be complete for some time.  \nOsprey contains the European power projects (Trakya and Saarlux), some North American merchant investments, and some Brazilian assets.  \nUnder the merger agreement, Enron cannot dispose of assets representing more than 15% of the balance sheet without Dynegy approval.  However, an appendix to the agreement holds a list of assets that are specifically permitted to be sold without Dynegy approval.  \nBroadband is expected to be fully wound up 'sometime over the course of the next year'.  (Did not catch this part clearly).  \nThe ENE topup obligation for Marlin (represented by ENE common that would have to be delivered) will be converted into an obligation for an equivalent amount of DYN shares upon closing.  \n$1.9Bn of debt is carried at the Azurix level.  \nCurrent book value of the Osprey assets is $2.1Bn.  \nNo Dynegy outs other than the previously discussed general MAC clause and the $3.5Bn legal liability clause.  \nYosemite and the Credit-Linked notes are functionally equivalent to ENE senior unsecured debt (this section somewhat unclear).  The underlying transactions represented volumes of 'crude oil and gas'.  The transactions relate to the 'physical movement' of these commodities.  The swaps related to Yosemite and the CLNs would be financially settled.  \nWhalley was asked about the return of trading business to normal volumes.  He said that he cannot yet give an update on the progress of customers returning to our longer-term products.  Acknowledges that a few anxious customers put long-term deals on hold last week.  Says that our first focus is on getting our short-term business back up to normal levels.  It will be 'a couple of weeks' before we're able to give an update on the comfort levels of our customers regarding long-term deals with us.  \nMcMahon:  There hasn't been a major relaxation of credit requirements by our customers--credit requirements continue to follow strict contractual provisions as called for in our individual agreements with our various customers.  But 'we have seen a return of some of the transactions, some of the flows.'\nWhalley says that we're hoping to see a return to more normal trading levels late this week or early next week.\nLay says that cost cuts will be made across of all of our businesses.  The situation gives us an opportunity to review our entire cost structure, he says.  The cuts will certainly be deeper in our non-core businesses.  Whalley then quickly interjects (some might say interrrupts) with a clarification that there are no plans to reduce the size of our North American energy trading business.  We will be looking at, perhaps, streamlining some of our processes and making prudent adjustments, but there are no plans to reduce the size of the business.\nMcMahon:  \"The company is overlevered; that's a fact.\"--hence our pursuit of additional equity.\nMcMahon mentions that business was better at the start of this week than at the end of last week.\nENE had approx. $1Bn in cash as of 9/30, which McMahon points out would be unusual for us.  \n\nAs before, give me a call at 3-3055 if you'd like more color.\n\nPatrick Tucker",

    "Body": "Confidential Settlement Document\nPer CPUC Rule 51\n\nGas Accord II Settlement Participants:\n\n\nAttached is PG&E's Gas Accord II (GA II) Settlement Proposal.  We believe it\naddresses many of the issues and concerns you have raised in the workshops.\n\n\nAs an overview, this proposal:\n\n* Maintains the basic Gas Accord structure in place today for the\nperiod 2003 to 2007.\n*\n* Offers end user transportation rates for 2003 lower for most\ncustomers than rates in effect today.\n*\n* Provides for vintaged Redwood path rates for core customers.\n*\n* Offers a 7.5 cent/dth rate to large customers while minimizing rate\nchanges to other customers, minimizing the incentive for these customers to\nseek to bypass local transmission charges and other CPUC-approved charges.\n*\n* Adopts guidelines to improve reliability and help moderate prices in\ngas commodity markets, and identifies the capital projects needed to meet\nthese guidelines over the course of the GA II period (2003-2007).\n*\n* Provides a high degree of rate stability, with a 3.5% escalator to\ncapture both inflation and the cost of needed capital projects.  The\nguaranteed rates will be adjustable only for significant changes in the cost\nof capital or increased costs due to governmental requirements or\ncatastrophic events.\n*\n* Preserves a rate differential between the Redwood and Baja paths,\nalthough somewhat less than the current differential.\n*\n* Proposes a two-stage open season for firm transportation services\nbeginning in 2003, with end users receiving a first option on available\ncapacity.\n*\n* Maintains the core aggregation program with some adjustments.\n\nPG&E also anticipates that the Core Procurement Incentive Mechanism (CPIM)\nwill be similar to today's mechanism, but will reflect the somewhat larger\ncapacity holdings needed to meet anticipated increases in core demand and to\nmeet a 1-day in 10-year cold weather event.\n\nThis also will serve as a reminder that an all-Party meeting is scheduled at\nPG&E's headquarters in San Francisco on January 10 and 11, to discuss this\nproposal and to respond to your questions.  We look forward to answering\nyour questions and receiving your feedback.\n\nThe attached documents include the GA II Settlement proposal, an Attachment\n(a copy of PG&E's proposed Gas Rule 27), and a set of supporting workpapers.\n\nFinally, please note that the Settlement document and the Attachment are in\n\"Word 2000\" format.  We would be glad to provide the same documents in an\nearlier version of Word, upon request by individual Parties.\n\nWe look forward to seeing you on January 10-11.  In the meantime, we extend\nour best wishes for a safe and happy holiday season.\n\n\nFrank Lindh     Ray Williams\n(415) 973-2776    (415) 973-3634\n\n<<PG&E Gas Accord II Settlement Proposal 12-20-00.doc>>  <<Proposed Gas\nRule 27.doc>>  <<COS & Rates Workpapers for GA II 12-20-2000 Proposal.xls>>\n\n - PG&E Gas Accord II Settlement Proposal 12-20-00.doc\n - Proposed Gas Rule 27.doc\n - COS & Rates Workpapers for GA II 12-20-2000 Proposal.xls",

    "Body": "Today, we announced plans to merge with Dynegy, a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties.  Dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own.  We believe merging with Dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you've worked so hard to build.  Following are the major components of the transaction.\n\nDeal Terms\n\n--\tThe transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of 0.2685 Dynegy shares for every Enron share.  For example, each 1,000 shares of Enron stock will be converted to 268 shares of Dynegy upon closing, plus cash for fractional shares, upon closing.\n--\tChevronTexaco owns approximately 26 percent of Dynegy's outstanding common stock.  ChevronTexaco will invest $1.5 billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional $1 billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger.  Dynegy will immediately invest $1.5 billion in cash in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas.\n--   Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares.\n--   The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close late next year.\n\nEnron will have immediate access to Dynegy's $1.5 billion cash investment in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary.\n\nManagement of Newly Formed Company\n\nChuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company, which will be called Dynegy Inc., and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO.\n\nI will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes.  I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Greg Whalley will continue to serve as president and COO of Enron until the transaction closes.  Then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Mark Frevert will continue as vice chairman of Enron.\n\nManagement from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth, efficient integration.  The make-up of the integration team has not yet been determined.\n\nThe merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2002.  This merger will create an enormous growth engine, providing great opportunities for our employees, shareholders and customers.  As with any merger, some elimination of positions is almost inevitable, and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company.  We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions.  Clearly, we cannot rule out involuntary separation, but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations.  I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible.\n\nAs I said in my video, this is a day like no other in our company's history.  We considered several options, but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses.\n\nI know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps.  We have a list of frequently asked questions posted at <http://home.enron.com/updates/>.  If you have additional questions, please submit them to questions@enron.com <mailto:questions@enron.com>.  We will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions.  If you receive any calls from the media, please refer them to our media team at (713) 853-5670.\n\nI ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company.  Rather than closing doors, we are opening new ones, as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise, including our market reach, financial strength and industry experience.  Together, we will be a new merchant powerhouse.\n\nAnd again, thank you for everything you have done for Enron.\n\n\nInvestors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint proxy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes available, because it will contain important information.

    "Body": "NGI's Daily Gas Price Index \nBreaking News : posted Jan 9, 2:28 PM\nDynegy Not Opposed to Enron Auction; Senate Subcommittee to Issue 51 Subpoenas \nNearly 20 of bankrupt Enron Corp.'s creditors have apparently filed motions to delay the scheduled auction of the company's trading assets this week, but one-time merger partner and creditor Dynegy Corp. will not be one of them, a spokesman said Wednesday. However, whether the auction proceeds as planned, Enron is facing more obstacles on the legal front with 51 subpoenas requesting documents expected to be issued Friday by the Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. \nThe U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York has been asked by the creditors to delay approving any offer for Enron's trading business, once the most profitable unit of the company. The motion to delay was requested to allow the creditors time to look at the assets up for sale. Included in the auction are assets from its EnronOnline operation, which Enron would like to use in a joint venture with a cash-rich company. \nUnder Enron's proposal, a 51% joint venture partner would form a new company with Enron to be called New Energy Trading Co., or NETCO. Enron would contribute information technology and back office systems among other things, in exchange for a 49% stake. As of late Monday, UBS AG, Citigroup Inc. and BP had made bids for some of the assets. \nAmong those opposing the auction, now set for Thursday with a decision on the winning bids as early as Friday, is the Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc, which said, \"Absent a disclosure of the intended uses for the proceeds of this sale, the creditors are unable to gauge that the benefits are adequate, appropriate and directed to the proper beneficiaries.\" Kansas City, MO-based Aquila also is opposed to the auction because of concerns about how the proceeds would be used. Aquila wants the auction's proceeds put in escrow until it is determined which units of Enron receive the money. \nHowever, Dynegy does not plan to oppose the auction, said company spokesman Steve Stengel, who also expressed surprise that any company would want to delay it. \"Dynegy has not taken any action to delay the sale of Enron's trading business,\" he told NGI. Stengel also confirmed that the scheduled sale of Northern Natural Gas Co. from Enron to Dynegy is still set to close by the end of January. \nStill to come is word on who and what documents are being subpoenaed by the Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. The subpoenas will be served on Enron, its accounting firm Andersen and 49 individual officers, employees and members of the board of directors. The subcommittee is one of five congressional panels investigating the fallen giant along with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the Department of Labor and the Department of Justice. \n\"The subcommittee is looking into the role of the officers and board members, the role of the auditors, and the role of special-purpose entities,\" a subcommittee spokesman told Reuters. These are some of the same types of things being investigated by the House of Representatives Financial Services Committee, the Senate Commerce Committee and the House and Senate Energy committees. The spokesman said the subpoenas would allow Enron and the others \"several weeks\" to respond.",

They include innovative measures to encourage\nthe siting of power plants in compliance with the state=01,s environmental\nlaws, restructuring the state=01,s power-buying agencies to eliminate confl=\nicts\nof interests, and promoting energy conservation and voluntary cutbacks by\nlarger users during periods of high electricity demand.\n\n\"If you do your job of protecting consumers by rectifying the wholesale\nmarkets, the steps I have to take can be transitional in nature and limited\nin scope,\" wrote Gov. Davis, who also reiterated his call to FERC to order\nretroactive refunds to San Diego and Orange County consumers, and to impose\nprice caps on the price of wholesale electricity. \"I cannot in good\nconscience, however, forego any measure that would serve to protect the\npeople of California until I am satisfied that the sellers in the wholesale\nmarkets will not victimize Californians again.\"\n\nGovernor Davis, who inherited the problems of deregulation as a result of\nlegislation signed by Governor Pete Wilson in 1996, said that \"The free\nmarket applied to electricity can work, but only if market conditions allow\nfor real competition, and if all parties act responsibly.\" The Governor\nadded \"Even though FERC had recently concluded that California=01,s market =\nwas\n=01+dysfunctional,=01, its draft proposal fails to include measures to stop\nout-of-state electrical generators from price gouging, and would lead to\nhigher prices next summer.\"\n\nThe Governor=01,s proposals include:\n\nIntroducing legislation to dramatically change the membership of the ISO an=\nd\nPX, eliminating members of the board that have what he called \"inherent\nconflicts of interest\" and replacing them with independent members;\n\nSeeking legislation that will allow new approaches - such as emissions\ncredit trading - to aid in the siting of new power plants;\n\nCalling on the state=01,s Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to promote\ndistributed generation and co-generation;\n\nAccelerating voluntary efforts by the private sector as well as state\nagencies to reduce their energy use during peak periods;\n\nExpanding \"forward contracting\" by utilities that would allow multi-year\ncontracts to reduce price volatility and ensure reliability;\n\nAsking the PUC to expedite its investigation of the state=01,s electricity\ndemand reduction programs for commercial users, and adopt new programs to\nallow voluntary interruptions that will allow the reduction of electricity\nuse during peak power periods;\n\nReviewing new measures to coordinate power-plant maintenance and operating\nactivities;\n\nRequiring utilities to retain their existing generation facilities instead\nof selling them off at least until the market becomes competitive; and\n\nCalling on the PUC and California Energy Commission (CEC) to study providin=\ng\n\"real time price signals\" (such as metering) to large energy users to reduc=\ne\nenergy use.\n\nGovernor Davis noted that in the decade prior to his administration, no\npower plants were built in the state. But since April 1999, six power plant=\ns\nrepresenting 4,700 MW of new generation have been approved. Twenty more\napplications are under review and 11 more are in the pipeline.\n\n\"This represents a significant change in policy and performance and respond=\ns\nto the fact that we must increase supply as rapidly as possible without\nabrogating our commitment to state and federal public health and\nenvironmental protection,\" he said.\n\nThe Governor=01,s initiatives announced today reflects his commitment to FE=\nRC\nChairman James Hoecker at a hearing last month in San Diego to provide inpu=\nt\ninto FERC=01,s final order on the California electricity market. That decis=\nion\ncould come as early as December 13, 2000.\n\nThe Governor will continue to meet with legislative leaders, consumer\ngroups, and other interested parties to discuss additional options. He said\na more complete plan cannot be developed until FERC=01,s final order has be=\nen\nannounced and analyzed.",

Still, those companies that own generation in the state say they\nwelcome the probe into the power market by Attorney General Bill Lockyer.\n\"We have done nothing wrong at all,\" said Tom Williams, spokesman for Duke\nEnergy North America (DUK). \"Our plants have been running all summer long.\nPrices are high throughout the west. We wouldn't invest $1.7 billion in new\ngeneration and then try and rig the market.\"  For the past two months,\nutilities, lawmakers and other market participants have made allegations\nthat generators are manipulating the market and are largely responsible for\nthe price spikes.  Locker's office said an investigation is still pending.\nState regulators are also conducting their own investigation, the findings\nof which will be submitted to the governor and the Federal Energy Regulatory\nCommission by the end of the year.  Allegations Said Unsubstantiated  There\nisn't a shred of evidence to support allegations, said Severing Borenstein,\ndirector of the University of California, Berkley's, Energy Institute.\n\"There are no antitrust laws that state you can't charge a premium price for\npower,\" Borenstein said. \"Manipulation is a bad word. That's used in the\ncommodities market to find a loophole and take advantage of the rules.  \"I\nwould say this is exercising market power. ... If you want to charge high\nprices you can. These are guys who play against each other every day. There\nis no sort of collusion that would interest the justice department ... .\"\nThe reason for the inquiry ordered By Gov. Gray Davis, he said, is as a\nconsequence of San Diego consumers being the first in the nation to pay\nmarket-based rates for electricity.  The high wholesale costs paid by\nutility San Diego Gas & Electric, a unit of Sempra Energy (SRE), were passed\non to ratepayers and resulted in utility bills more than doubling.  Gov.\nDavis ordered the inquiry and asked federal regulators to conduct their own\ninvestigation as well.  Dynegy (DYN) President Steve Bergstrom also says\nthat an investigation \"will turn up nothing.\"  So why conduct one?  \"This is\na very politically charged issue,\" Bergstrom said. \"When something goes\nwrong you have to find someone to point the finger at.\"  A source in the\ngovernor's office said Davis is aware that Attorney General Lockyer's\ninvestigation may turn up nothing, but Gov. Davis \"has a responsibility to\nhis constituents.\"  Supply vs. Demand  What the investigation will turn up\nis evidence that there is a shortage of power in the state and not enough\npower plants being built to meet increasing demand, said Terry Winter,\nchairman and chief executive officer of the California Independent System\nOperator.  Winter said he doesn't believe that there is anything wrong with\nthe way generators sell their power and 98% of the time the market works\nwell.  \"Is it market abuse to bid at the price cap ($250 per megawatt-hour)\nknowing that you're 1,000 MW short? I have trouble identifying that as\nmarket power abuse,\" Winter said.  Despite some proposed regulatory changes,\nsuch as bid caps on wholesale energy prices and a rate freeze for SDG&E\ncustomers, Duke Energy, Dynegy, Southern Co. (SO) and Reliant (RLI) all\nstill plan to invest in generation in the state.  That's a different stance\nthan the companies took a month ago when the ISO reduced the wholesale price\ncap in the real-time market to $250/MWh.  \"At the end of the day the market\nis short power and you got to get people to build new generation,\" said\nDynegy's Bergstrom. \"We got a big investment in California. We're not\nwalking away from that.\"  -By Jason Leopold, Dow Jones Newswires;\n323-658-3874; jason.leopold@dowjones.com Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones &\nCompany Inc\n12:15 GMT 16 August 2000 DJ Calif ISO Urges FERC To Reject Pwr Producers'\nComplaint\n(This article was originally published Tuesday)\nWASHINGTON (Dow Jones)--California's power grid administrator Monday urged\nfederal regulators to reject a complaint from power producers seeking\ncompensation in the event out-of-state power transactions are curtailed\nduring an extreme power grid emergency.\nThe independent system operator told the Federal Energy Regulatory\nCommission that the power producers seek compensation in the event of a\n\"situation that never has occurred any time since the ISO began operations,\nand if it were to occur in the future, would do so rarely.\"\nThe ISO noted that its tariff governing access to the state's grid already\nallows for compensation in the event of curtailed exports, and decried the\npower producers' complaint as \"a collateral attack\" on a previous FERC order\nrejecting claims that the tariff failed to provide adequate compensation.\nCurtailing scheduled power transactions and exports would be a last resort\nmeasure taken only after other options have been exhausted, the ISO said.\nThe power producers should adjust their contracts to factor in the risk of\ninterruption in the event of a state-wide grid emergency, the ISO said.\nThe ISO's objections were echoed by the state's electricity distribution\nutilities and California regulators.\nThey complained that the power producers are merely trying to get out from\nunder the price controls the ISO has imposed in an effort to rein in\nskyrocketing power prices this summer.\nThe generators \"knew when they purchased California power plants and when\nthey entered into their export contracts that the ISO could alter their\nschedules in an emergency. For them to ask the commission to make it even\nmore expensive, and hence, more difficult, for the ISO to maintain grid\nreliability in California is irresponsible,\" said Southern California\nEdison, a unit of Edison International (EIX).\n\"The complaint is a sham,\" declared the California Public Utilities\nCommission.\n\"The true intent of the complaint ... is to avoid the ISO price caps by\nmaking sales to affiliates or cooperating entities located out of state, and\nsell the power back to the ISO at uncapped prices reflecting the generators'\nmarket power,\" the PUC said, calling for FERC to summarily reject the\ncomplaint.\n\"The complaint is factually unsupported, legally unfounded, complains of\nconduct consistent with the ISO's authority under pertinent FERC decisions,\nand seeks to avoid the price cap,\" the PUC said.\nBut power marketers and other power producers voiced support for the\ncomplaint, filed Aug. 3 by Reliant Power Generation Inc. (REI), Dynegy Power\nMarketing Inc. (DYN) and Southern Energy California (SO).\n\"By subjecting curtailed energy transactions to its maximum purchase price\nof $250, and simply ignoring the financial impact on sellers, the Cal ISO\nwould be overtly discriminating against export transactions and market\nparticipants who schedule energy for export,\" said the Electric Power Supply\nAssociation, the national trade group representing competitive power\nproducers.\n\"It is critical that power producers ... know with certainty that the\ncurtailment of scheduled energy exports by Cal ISO will be compensated,\"\nsaid Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc.\n\"Now that the ISO Governing Board has lowered purchase price caps to $250,\nit is significantly more likely that the curtailment of exports will occur\nmore frequently. Less energy will be imported into California and more\nenergy will leave California in search of higher prices,\" said Williams\nEnergy Marketing & Trading Co. in support of the complaint's call for actual\ndamages and lost opportunity costs.\nAt least one power purchaser voiced support for the producers' position as\nwell.\n\"It seems a very basic point that if the Cal ISO must divert the\ntransactions of others to meet its own loads, that is should pay the full\ncosts of doing so,\" said the Northern California Power Agency.\n-By Bryan Lee, Dow Jones Newswires; 202-862-6647; bryan.lee@dowjones.com\nCopyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company Inc\n\n\n\nG_nther A.

    "Body": "RTO Week\n\nDay 3 -- October 17, 2001\n\nStandardizing RTO Tariffs\n\nThe morning panel focused on which transmission services should be standardized in RTO tariffs across an interconnection or the entire country.  There were many diverse views on the panel, and the Staff and commissioners were somewhat more engaged in this session.  \n\nThe panelists were:  Ricky Bittle, Arkansas Electric Coop; Jim Caldwell, American Wind; Peter Esposito, Dynegy; Rory McMinn, New Mexico PSC; Glenn Ross, Dominion Resources; Audrey Zibelman, XCEL Energy.\n\nGeneral Observations\n\nThis panel had a lot less agreement than the previous panels.  Dynegy opposes standardization of a transmission tariff and urges FERC to give strong guidance to stakeholders and then let the stakeholders work out the details of a new tariff.  Dominion advocates a more prescriptive approach by FERC, noting that stakeholders have been unable to reach agreement over the last five years.  EXCEL has it's own focus - they want to be an ITC and want to provide many of the RTO services without being an RTO.  The Wind group is mostly concerned about the ability to provide generation on an \"as available\" basis.   The commissioner from New Mexico does not want standardization, does not want FERC stepping on the state's jurisdictional toes, and does not want New Mexico ratepayers' rates to go up.  Arkansas Electric Coop insists that SPP transmission capacity is full, so if competitors want to move power through SPP, new transmission must first be built.\n\nI am somewhat concerned that some of the Commissioners may believe that tariff standardization is not necessary.  While the Dynegy concept had merit at one time, it may be too late to rely on the stakeholder process to resolve issues, and it could take many months to go through the process, only to have FERC, in the end, decide the details anyway.  We may want to submit comments on this issue to FERC at the conclusion of RTO Week.\n\nWhat Services Should be Standardized?\n\nOverall, Dynegy opposes standardizing tariffs but believes certain aspects of reservations should be standardized -- timing, confirmation processing, maintenance issues, bus names, ramping protocols, assumptions for ATC calculations, posting times, bumping rules, and settlement time.  With regard to congestion management, it should not be standardized between RTOs.  \n\nXCEL does not support a standardized tariff but urges FERC to standardize some issues such as CBM calculations, reserve obligations and load balancing and penalties.  American Wind says FERC must focus on having liquid spot markets in RTOs and not worry about tariff standardization.  Dominion cautions FERC about Dynegy's proposal to let the industry work out the details.  He says this is what happened with Order No. 2000 and the industry was unable to work it out.  \n\nShould FERC Retain CBM?\n\nRicky (Arkansas Coop) believes that the bigger the RTO, the less important CBM is because the RTO will have enough resources internally to effectuate reserve sharing.  Dynegy thinks CBM should be eliminated.  Dominion thinks CBM should be retained but the rules need to be changed.  CBM should not be set for a year - it changes on a daily basis and this should be reflected.  Nor should CBM be standardized because needs vary region to region.  However, because CBM is used for load, the cost of CBM should be allocated to load.  All panelists agreed with the concept that if CBM is retained, load should be required to purchase it as a service provided under the tariff.\n\nNetwork Versus Point to Point Service\n\nPeter (Dynegy) discussed the need to develop a new type of transmission service that combines the best features from network and point to point, similar to transportation service offered in gas -- firm and interruptible.  Peter suggests starting with the CRT tariff proposed several years ago.  Glenn (Dominion) thinks the CRT is outdated and thinks we need a new type of service but agrees that it should combine the best elements of network and point to point.  \n\nShould all Transmission Service Be Under the RTO's Tariff?\n\nMost of the panelists said yes, all service should be under the tariff, but Ricky Bittle said there needs to be a transition period - minimum of 5 years, no more than 10 years.  Commissioner McMinn said no - he sees this as an infringement on the states' jurisdiction.\n\nWhat Services Need to Be Changed Under a New RTO Tariff?\n\nJim (Wind) believes that the imbalance provisions must be revised so as not to penalize \"as available\" resources.  Ricky thinks transmission expansion is the most important issue to address in a new tariff.  XCEL urges FERC to recognize the distinction between RTOs and ITCs and allow ITCs to design and offer their own transmission tariffs.\n\nRay Alvarez will circulate a summary of the afternoon panel on Cost Allocation.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions.\n\nSarah",

    "Body": "On Wed, I met at EPSA to discuss with members - the near term future \nparticipation of EPSA staff and members at NERC.\n\nA roster of participants follows this brief summary.\n\nMost members agreed in concept that NERC must continue to be monitored at \nleast in the near term because of their \"monopoly\" on the \nreliability/commercial rules.  There was agreement that NERC had moved into \nthe commercial/non-reliability standards setting partly becuase the \nincumbants desgined it that way and partly due to a lack of another industry \nrepresentative forum  for FERC to delegate to.  Some members were encouraged \nthat GISB was interested in becoming an alternative forum (EISB) and pointed \nto GISB successes in creating an efficient Bulletin Board for Gas in response \nto FERC orders.  The members also realized that most of the NERC problems are \ncaused by the native load exception which the gas industry did not have to \ndeal with making their restructuring easier.\n\nEPSA staff will focus on representing EPSA members' viewpoints to the \nindependent board members to establish working relationships and to provide \nmarket perspectives as well as governance problems within the NERC \nstructure.  \n\nMany EPSA members also felt that EPSA staff could do more to provide \ninformation regarding NERC issues that affect the markets so that a greater \nnumber of members can convey their positions to the NERC Committee and \nSubcommittee market representatives. Some possible email/members only \nbulletin board was discussed.\n\nReliant (John Orr) also expressed concern over continuing to allow NERC (as \nopposed to the RTOs)  to set the commercial standards.  Most agreed that NERC \ndoes not design efficient commercial/market standards and should leave the \nnon-reliablity rules to RTOs.  Others (myself, DENA, Ontario Power Gen) who \nparticipate on NERC groups agreed to this in concept but raised the problem \nthat many of the reliability rules overlap commercial rules with no \"bright \nline\" between the two.\n\nPlease contact me if you wish more details of the meeting.\nCharles Yeung\nX30348\n\nParticipants in person:\nCalpine - Jim Stanton\nDuke Energy NA - Lee Barrett, Mike Gildea\nDynegy - Mary Doyle, John Stauffacher\nEl Paso - Susan Ginsberg\nEnron - Charles Yeung\nOntario Power Gen - Barb Robertson\nPG&E - Jack Hawks\nReliant - John Orr\nPSEG - Dennis Sobieski\nEPSA - Mark Bennett, Lynne Church, Julie Simon\n\nParticipating via phone:\nBP Energy - Jeanne Zaiontz\nCalpine - Jana Phillips\nEdison Mission - Gail Chandler\nMirant - Pamela Hill\nTenaska - Mark Foreman\nTECO - Janet Sena\nWilliams - Mike Grim, Jane Mudgett",

    "Body": "This note is to report on two electricity legislative developments: the Aug. 2nd introduction of an anti-RTO bill (or at least anti-mandatory RTOs) and on a meeting I had yesterday afternoon with Andy Black, the policy coordinator for Chairman Joe Barton on the House Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee, to discuss their intentions with respect to electricity legislation this Fall.\n\n1.  H.R. 2814 (Reps. Tom Sawyer (D-OH) and Richard Burr (R-NC))\n\nOn Aug. 2nd (the last day Congress was in session before the August Recess), the above named members of the House Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee introduced H.R. 2814, the Interstate Transmission Act.  The legislation is bad because, among other things, it requires FERC to establish transmission pricing policies that provide incentives for voluntary participation and formation of RTOs, with language prohibiting policies that have the effect of forcing transmitting utilities to join RTOs.  Also objectionable is that the bill would \"limit\" pancaking but at the same time require FERC to establish a \"reasonable transition mechanism or period\" for additive charges.  The legislation prohibits FERC from conditioning any order upon a transmitting utility being required to transfer operational control of jurisdictional facilities to an ISO or RTO.  The bill would require that participating transmitting utilities must approve the form, structure and operating entity of any RTO.\n\nIn addition to the RTO language, the bill has the \"old\" version of the NERC reliability legislation in it.  The bill also has a PUHCA exemption for RTOs, repeals Federal Power Act sec. 203 on the disposition of property and includes the tax changes that IOUs seek for transfers of property to an independent transmission company.\n\nBarbara Hueter advises that First Energy has its hq in Rep. Sawyer's district.  Rep. Burr is from North Carolina, so perhaps Duke had its utility hat on in working with him.  I am checking into where Duke is on this issue.  Rep. Burr is the Vice Chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee and close to Chairman Tauzin -- so his support for this legislation is significant (see Andy Black comment below).\n\n2.  Andy Black Meeting\n\nAndy is meeting with various trade associations this month to discuss electricity legislation.  He is only meeting with a few companies on a one-on-one basis -- Enron, Reliant, Dynegy and TXU.  His timing is to have a legislative draft for Chairman Barton to review when Congress returns after Labor Day.  If Chairman Barton approves or makes changes, the draft will be circulated to members of the subcommittee and the public for further comment.  The intent is to mark up an electricity bill this Fall so that if the Senate acts on electricity in its comprehensive energy bill, the issue will be ripe for consideration in a House-Senate conference committee.  Here is a run down of my comments and Andy's comments on specific issues.\n\na.   RTOs\n\nChairman Barton supports RTOs.  At a minimum, the draft will affirm FERC's authority as the commissioners have requested.  Andy is considering going beyond that to mandate RTO participation.  Not sure he can hold that position in the subcommittee.  He is looking to Enron and others to help them explain and build support for RTOs.  Informed him of our initial informal coalition steps.  However, Andy asked me to look at sec. 3 of the Sawyer-Burr referenced above, which I realized after the meeting is the part that deals with incentive rates and negotiated rates to expand transmission and voluntary RTOs.  I have a call in to Andy to reconcile these statements since the Sawyer-Burr bill is based on voluntary RTOs.  Hopefully, he is thinking of using the incentive and negotiated rate language and NOT the objectionable voluntary RTO aspects.  I will strongly encourage him to \"do the right thing\" in that regard.\n\nb.   PUHCA\n\nThe draft will use the Pickering bill (H.R. 1101).  Told Andy about our concerns with the record keeping provisions of that bill.  Will send him our legislative language to clarify these provisions so that they do not open up all of Enron's records -- even those unrelated to transactions with a regulated utility affiliate.\n\nc.  PURPA\n\nProspective repeal.  On back up power, they are thinking of requiring that rates for back up power be just and reasonable until there is retail competition in the state.\n\nd.   Interconnection\n\nThey have received a proposal from Trigen that Andy says we will like.  I am contacting EPSA to get the details.\n\ne.   Net Metering\n\nThey are likely to include the Inslee bill to require \"net metering.\"  I explained our concern that the bill's mandate applies to all retail energy suppliers -- including EES -- even though this should only apply to utilities with an obligation to serve; that it does not make sense to mandate it on service providers like EES (per Jim's helpful comments yesterday).  I need to get more information to Andy.\n\nf.   Transmission Jurisdiction\n\nThankfully, Andy is NOT going to use those portions of the bill as reported by subcommittee in the last Congress that gave use heart burn on jurisdiction.  Specifically, the draft will not say FERC does not have jurisdiction over the transportation component of a bundled retail sale -- the draft will not get into the bundled/unbundled issue at all.  The draft will bring munis, co-ops and PMAs under the FERC umbrella for transmission jurisdiction purposes.\n\ng.   Siting\n\nOn siting, Andy is thinking of some type of mechanism that would give a State one year before federal eminent domain attaches.\n\nh.   Reliability\n\nOn a negative note, Andy intends to use the latest NERC reliability language because NERC's version has strong support among the Members of the subcommittee and no other alternative has emerged with political support (i.e., not PJM).  I explained our concerns.  He said our best bet is for DoE or FERC to come forward to seek something other than the NERC version.  He said Members eyes glaze over on reliability with everything else on the plate.\n\ni.   Negawatts\n\nI raised the absence of negawatts on his issue list.  He said he is open to considering it again, but that there was left over political baggage and unresolved issues from when this was attempted during consideration of the \"California bill\" earlier this summer.\n\nYour questions and comments on the any of the above are most welcome.",

    "Body": "Folks,\n\nLate Friday afternoon Ziad called me.  The ISO Governing Board earlier\nthe same day turned down the ISO management's request to force SCs to\nplace 95% of their scheduled load in the DA market.  That leaves the ISO\nlittle choice but to venture into the energy markets to procure power to\ncover their peak hours on hot days.\n\nTerry gave Ziad the OK to proceed with placing both the APX and\nCalifornia PX screens for this new product/matching-service.  I am\nworking with the two vendors and the ISO to make this happen quickly.\nWe anticipate that the market will open on Tuesday, September 5, or\nearlier.\n\nKey people who you may need to contact:\nISO - Ziad Alaywan  916-351-2140 (Nancy Traweek and Jim McIntosh are\nalso in the loop)\nPX - Ken Czarnecki 626-537-3123\nPX - John Yurkanin 626-537-3124\nAPX - Denice Cazalet 408-517-2123\nAPX - Michael Heinrich 408-517-2159\n\nPlease feel free to contact me with your questions.  Several of you have\nnot had the opportunity to attend the pre-design meetings we had at the\nCalifornia PX and APX a few weeks ago, nor were you aware of the joint\nWPTF/ISO meeting held last week.  But in essence, what this\nproduct/matching-service will allow you to do is post bids to sell, or\nbuy a 6-hour block of capacity at a firm energy price across the hours\nof HE13 to HE18.  You can bid at COB, Mead, PV, SP15 or NP15.  You can\nutilize either the CalPX or APX to post your bids, because the ISO will\nbe watching both screens.  The block sizes are (supposed to be) 25MW.\nThe seller is responsible for arranging transmission to the delivery\npoint, and the buyer (e.g., ISO) is responsible for arranging\ntransmission service from the delivery point.  The ISO will make its\npurchase decisions for the day-of at or before 8:00 a.m.  The ISO will\nsend out a general notice when it needs offers to sell on the super-peak\nmarket.  I expect that bids for either buy or sell will be able to be\nposted at any time, 24 hours.  The screens should allow parties to post\nbuy or sell bids at least 60 days forward of the trade day.\n\nYou are not limited to a price cap in these markets, but the ISO as a\nbuyer has the right to not purchase at prices above it's price cap.\n\nI think WPTF members should be very proud that we were able to quickly\nwork together, and with the ISO to create this market. I have no doubt\nthe ISO will be offering bids to purchase starting Sept 5, and going\nforward 60 days.  However, who among you will be willing and able to\npost bids to sell?\n\ngba",

MRT (a Reliant pipeline)\nhas been the only pipeline into this market.  \n\n\nNGPL Plans Lateral to Serve Illinois Power in St. Louis\n\nNatural Gas Pipeline Company of America (NGPL) announced plans to build a new \n47-mile, 24-inch diameter pipeline lateral into St. Louis to serve Illinois \nPower's gas distribution system. The $35 million project, which is anchored \nby a contract with Illinois Power affiliate Dynegy Marketing and Trade, will \nadd at least 300,000 Dth/d of gas transportation capacity to the St. Louis \nmarket. \n\n\"The pipeline project and related agreements ideally demonstrate our ongoing \nstrategy to expand our natural gas pipeline services into growing markets \ncurrently not connected to NGPL and to increase throughput on our system by \nadding electric load to our extensive pipeline network,\" said Richard D. \nKinder, CEO of Kinder Morgan Inc., the parent company of NGPL. \n\nThe new lateral will extend from Centralia, IL, to a point on Illinois \nPower's gas distribution system in the East St. Louis market. The project is \nscheduled for completion in June of 2002. \n\nNGPL and Dynegy entered into a number of long-term, gas transportation and \nstorage contracts, including a 10-year agreement effective June 1, 2002, \nwhich will provide Dynegy with 90,000 Dth/d of gas via the new pipeline. In \naddition, NGPL and Dynegy entered into various other firm transportation \nagreements totaling another 98,000 Dth/d of gas sourced from NGPL's Gulf \nCoast and Amarillo lines beginning as early as Dec. 1, 2000. \n\nThe NGPL project effectively creates a new supplier for a geographical area \nthat until now has been served by just one natural gas transportation company \n[Mississippi River Transmission], according to Larry F. Altenbaumer, \npresident of Illinois Power. \"This new connection to Illinois Power's system \nwill help open competitive opportunities to natural gas customers in the \nmetro east area of St. Louis. It not only provides for a new delivery point \nto service customers directly, but also to fuel electric generation in the \narea. \n\n\"The 10-year agreement to provide firm transportation service to Dynegy \nprovides us a solid anchor customer for the pipeline project,\" said Deb \nMacdonald, president of NGPL. NGPL intends to solicit expressions of interest \nfrom other shippers in December and January. The results of the open season \nwill determine the final scope of the project. \n\n\"With Dynegy as our anchor customer, we will build the new lateral into the \nSt. Louis market regardless of whether we receive other expressions of \ninterest,\" said Macdonald. \"We anticipate a strong response, however, given \nthe size of the market and the potential for additional gas-fired power \ngeneration.\" \n\nInterested shippers should contact Mark Menis, NGPL's director of business \ndevelopment, at (630) 691-3347.",

Report was completed, submitted to\nthe governor and released on August 2.\n\nOn July 27, 2000, Governor Davis called on federal and state regulators to\ntake swift action to extend the caps on wholesale electric rates in\nCalifornia and provide San Diego ratepayers with million of dollars in\nrefunds.\n\nIn letters written by the governor to two state regulatory agencies and two\nCalifornia-based panels charged with overseeing California's power market,\nhe called for a coordinated state effort to urge federal regulators to take\nstrong measures to reduce power rates in both the short- and long-term.\n\nOn August 2, 2000, Governor Davis issued three Executive Orders designed to\nreduce energy consumption by state government and speed up the time it takes\nnew power generating facilities to win approval from state agencies.\n\nOn August 9, 2000, Governor Davis called on the Public Utilities Commission\n(PUC) to establish a two-year plan that would cut electricity rates by\nnearly half for residential and business customers of San Diego Gas &\nElectric.\n\nThe governor also reached an agreement with the California Grocers\nAssociation that will save enough electricity to provide power to between\n50,000 and 60,000 homes during periods of peak demand, as grocers agreed to\nreduce power consumption by 10 percent during Stage One emergencies.\n\nOn August 10, 2000, Governor Davis wrote a letter to President Clinton\nurging him to expedite FERC's investigation to determine whether current\nelectric rates in San Diego were unjust.\n\nOn August 22, 2000, Governor Davis called on President Clinton to release\nemergency funds from the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP)\nto the state to help low-income Californians pay their rapidly-rising\nelectricity bills.\n\nOn August 23, 2000, President Clinton responded to Governor Davis' request\nby releasing $2.6 million in emergency funds to help low-income Southern\nCalifornians cope with the surge in their electricity bills. The President\nalso asked federal regulators to speed up their investigation into the\noperation of U.S. power markets and urged the Small Business Administration\nto use its credit programs to help small firms hurt by the price increases.\n\nOn August 23, 2000, Governor Davis reached agreement with legislators on\nlegislation to provide relief to San Diego ratepayers. The governor signed\ntwo bills into law on September 6, 2000.\n\nPlease see attached letter (below).\n\n# # #\n\nSEPTEMBER 12, 2000\n\nSTATEMENT OF GOVERNOR GRAY DAVIS\n\nTO THE FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION CONCERNING ITS INVESTIGATION OF\nWHOLESALE PRICE ESCALATION IN CALIFORNIA\n\nThe Summer of 2000 has confronted California with an electricity crisis that\nseriously threatens the safety, health and well being of citizens and\nbusinesses throughout the state. At the heart of the crisis is the\nextraordinary run up in prices for wholesale electric energy and ancillary\nservices, accompanied by deteriorating service and reliability. In San\nDiego, electric customers' bills have more than doubled this summer,\nthreatening permanent harm to businesses and the health and welfare of\nresidential customers in the warm southern climate. All remaining California\nelectric consumers are faced with similar prospects as their legislated rate\nfreeze periods come to an end. In San Francisco we saw rolling blackouts for\nthe first time in our history.\n\nAs soon as the dimensions of the crisis became evident, I directed\nCalifornia regulators, including the Public Utilities Commission and the\nElectricity Oversight Board, and the Independent System Operator, to take\nimmediate steps to identify and implement specific measures to mitigate the\ndamage, including restoring price caps at Summer 1999 levels. I am happy to\nreport that those measures have been adopted, although not without\nconsiderable resistance from self-interested parties.\n\nIn recent weeks, I have worked with the California Legislature to enact\nfurther relief within the existing framework of options now available to the\nstate. These include provisions to stabilize retail rates, expedite\ngeneration licensing where possible, implement targeted demand reduction and\ndemand response and remove constraints in transmission and distribution\nsystems. I have also established a task force comprised of key state\nofficials which is developing measures to increase energy efficiency and\nalternative supplies and to expedite permitting by state agencies.\n\nWhile these actions should provide short-term rate predictability and\nlonger-term benefits to customers in terms of improved supplies, the\nfundamental problem of exorbitant wholesale prices still exists and remains\nthe responsibility of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to address.\nNo combination of state actions can substitute for federal action to\nameliorate the problems in California's wholesale markets.\n\nA joint report submitted to me on August 2nd by the Chairman of the\nCalifornia Electricity Oversight Board and the President of the California\nPublic Utilities Commission concluded that exorbitant wholesale prices in\nCalifornia result from wholesale market dysfunction and the exercise of\nmarket power by sellers. Subsequent reports by the Market Analysis\nDepartment and the Market Surveillance Committee of the California\nIndependent System Operator reach the same conclusions. Subsequent behavior\nof wholesale electric prices during August confirms their conclusions, and\nsubjects California to further economic damage. While I remain hopeful that\nCalifornia wholesale markets may ultimately become competitive and become\ncapable of serving the interests of consumers and the public, I cannot and\nwill not accept the liabilities to California that result from the current\nsituation for even a short period. I intend to take any and all steps\nnecessary to restore economic stability to the electric service\ninfrastructure of California.\n\nFERC bears the responsibility under its organic act to assure just and\nreasonable wholesale electric rates. FERC bears responsibility to ensure\nthat a workably competitive market exists before California consumers and\nCalifornia's economy are subjected to unconstrained, market-based\nelectricity prices. Consequently, I renew my prior request that the\nCommission act with utmost speed to intervene to the fullest extent possible\nto restore wholesale prices to fair levels and to remedy harms that have\nresulted from the exercise of market power.\n\n###\n\nOFFICE OF THE GOVERNOR\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n----\nA00:245\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\nSeptember 12, 2000\n\nGOVERNOR DAVIS NAMES KAHN CHAIR OF THE GOVERNOR'S CLEAN ENERGY GREEN TEAM\nSACRAMENTO - Governor Gray Davis today announced the appointment of Michael\nA. Kahn as chairman of the newly-created Governor's Clean Energy Green Team.\nThe Team was created by Governor Davis' signing of AB 970 by Assemblywoman\nDenise Moreno Ducheny (D-San Diego) on Wednesday.\n\nMr. Kahn, 51, of San Francisco, is the chairman of the California\nElectricity Oversight Board, and he also serves as vice-chair of the\nCalifornia Commission on Judicial Performance. He has been senior partner\nand head of litigation at Folger Levin & Kahn LLP since 1979. Mr. Kahn has\nheld numerous state and federal government appointments and assignments over\nthe last 15 years.\n\nMr. Kahn is the author of several articles and reports on litigation\npractice and Supreme Court history.

    "Body": "I've been provided a bootleg copy of the results of the El Paso open season.  Here's the most interesting thing... El Paso waived its right of first refusal under the one year deal done last year, and participated with everyone else in the open season.  Accordingly, they were allocated capacity along with everyone else.  Remember, all these deals were [supposedly] done at EPNG's max rates.  There were approx. 30 successful bidders, and their bids were for various term lengths.  Here are the more significant awards:\n\nBurlington-  7,000\nCEG Energy Options-  37,800\nCoral-  15,000\nDuke-  212,000\nDynegy- 56,500\nEl Paso Merchant- 277,000\nENA-  254,000\nMGI Supply (Pemex)- 38,000\nOxy-  19,000\nPG&E (et al.)- 151,000\nSMUD-  10,000\nSempra Trading-  6,500\nSoCal- 19,000\nTexaco-  58,500\nWilliams- 11,500\n\nHere's the other EPNG news flash... apparently, EPNG is telling shippers to be on the lookout for an announcement next week of another open season to guage shippers interest in a major expansion of its system.  I'm assuming at this point this project will include the All American pipeline asset.\n\nI'm also now told that the Kern River expansion may be much larger than what we were led to believe a couple of weeks ago.  We heard earlier that they were looking at doing a 500 MMcf/d expansion that would include the 124 MMcf/d expansion already sold.  New information suggests that the 500 MMcf/d expansion may be significantly understated, and volumes may approach 700 - 800 MMcf/d.  The expansion would include not only compression, but would involve additional pipe, and would not be rolled into existing rates, but would be an incrementally priced project.",

    "ReplyChain1": "From: =09Dernehl, Ginger =20\nSent:=09Friday, November 16, 2001 2:45 PM\nTo:=09Shapiro, Richard\nSubject:=09Government Affairs Organization Announcement\n\n\nWith the announcement of Enron's acquisition by Dynegy behind us, and with =\nthe initial severance process completed, it seemed an appropriate time to e=\nffect some organizational changes so that we as a group are better prepared=\n to meet the challenges of the future.  Before I turn to the organizational=\n changes, I would like to say a few words about those who will be leaving t=\nhe company as a result of the initial severance (you'll know who they are b=\ny their absence on the organizational chart): Leading and being a part of t=\nhis group has been a privilege?I am thankful for every day that I have had =\nthat responsibility and thankful for however long I continue to have the re=\nsponsibility.  This sense of privilege and thankfulness is primarily driven=\n by having had the opportunity to get to know and care about such a dedicat=\ned group of professionals and support staff and who, to a person, are also =\nvery decent and good people.  To say good-bye to some of our colleagues is =\nnot easy.  I want to, on behalf of all of us, thank them for their hard wor=\nk, their integrity, their decency, and the good times and laughter that we =\nshared.  I trust that many of us will find ways to sustain friendships that=\n have been and will continue to be very special.  Thanks to each of you who=\n are leaving for all you have done.\n\nAs to the organizational structure, it has become increasingly apparent to =\nme that the existing organization, with a mix of groups organized along fun=\nctional and regional lines (particularly within the U.S.), has impeded our =\nability to get things done in the most efficient fashion at times.  The nee=\nd to rationalize the organizational structure, in order to consolidate all =\nU.S. energy functions, is a strong need from my perspective.  As a result, =\nJim Steffes will lead the U.S. Energy group along with Sue Nord, who will j=\nointly report to Jim and myself.  Sue will assist Jim in the leadership of =\nthe group and take on project management responsibilities as warranted to h=\nelp Jim shoulder a significant burden.  Also reporting to Jim will be a lea=\ndership group for U.S. Energy that will be as follows:  Wholesale Electrici=\nty will be led by Christi Nicolay; Retail Electricity and Natural Gas will =\nbe led by Harry Kingerski; Wholesale Gas will be led by Leslie Lawner.   La=\nst, but not least, Jeff Dasovich and Sue Mara, who will continue to focus o=\nn California energy issues, will report to Jim. (Sue Mara will also be part=\n of the Wholesale electricity team).\n\nSteve Montovano, who will continue to report to me, will lead a commercial =\ndevelopment effort along with Dan Allegretti.\n\nWith the elimination of the regional groups, I also recognize that there is=\n a need to continue to focus on how we as a group address our political/leg=\nislative needs across the U.S.  Paul Kaufman will lead a small group that w=\nill address that need and that will focus on state political support.  Paul=\n will also take the lead for Government Affairs in support of corporate dev=\nelopment efforts across the U.S.\n\nMuch of the rest of the group remains the same.  Linda Robertson will conti=\nnue to lead the Washington group with Sarah Novosel, who reports to Linda, =\ntaking the lead role in our coordination of activities at FERC.  Amr Ibrahi=\nm will continue to lead the support of the Global Assets group and also con=\ntinue to manage the Risk Analytics function.  Maggy Huson will take over su=\npport of the non-energy business units, which are as follows: Global Market=\ns, Industrial Markets, Networks, and Broadband.  Rob Hemstock will continue=\n to lead the support of Enron Canada.  Paul Dawson, who heads up government=\n affairs for Europe; Sergio Assad, who heads up government affairs for Sout=\nh America; and Mike Grimes and Mark Crowther, who head up our Asian efforts=\n, will continue to jointly report to the business units and myself.\n\nI am also forming a North American leadership group for Government Affairs =\nto provide policy guidance for the larger group and the company.  That Comm=\nittee will consist of Rob Hemstock, Maggy Huson, Amr Ibrahim, Paul Kaufman,=\n Harry Kingerski, Leslie Lawner, Steve Montovano, Christi Nicolay, Sue Nord=\n, Sarah Novosel, Linda Robertson, Jim Steffes and myself.  We will also con=\ntinue to have an RCR Committee that will consist of Maggy Huson, Harry King=\nerski, Sue Nord, Linda Robertson, Jim Steffes & myself.  Finally, I am form=\ning a Dynegy/Enron regulatory approvals working group that will consist of =\nJose Bestard, Paul Dawson, Paul Kaufman, Sue Nord, Sarah Novosel and myself=\n.\n\nNo organizational structure or set of organizational changes is either perf=\nect or permanent.  I believe these changes will make us better and more pre=\npared for the future.  However, we must be prepared to further adjust as th=\ne future unfolds for the company.\n\nOne final note: I am deeply sorry that each of you has had to live through =\nthis uncertain and troubled period for the company.  We are all saddened by=\n the recognition that we are in the midst of changes that will leave our gr=\noup fundamentally altered, but we must resolve to do our best for each othe=\nr and ourselves during this period of change to ensure that what emerges, f=\nor those of us who do remain a part of the new Dynegy, reflects the excelle=\nnce and integrity that has characterized our group.  Personally, I will do =\nall I can, for as long as I can, to steer the group through this to the ver=\ny best place possible.  Your continued dedication and support is very much =\nappreciated.  Hang in there and thanks."

Please make sure you read so that you become familiar with the new standby procurement penalty rules for the G-IMB tariff.\nIn a nut shell: \n         \n1) Penalty is now calculated at 150% of highest daily border price index at the SoCal border. \n2) The charge should begin from the first day of the \"flow month\" and end five days prior to the start of each corresponding imbalance trading period.\n3)  The charge will be posted at least one day in advance of each corresponding imbalance trading period. \nSince this became effective on June 1, SoCalGas will determine the highest daily border price during the period of June 1 through July 20 and post it no later than July 24.  Customers are assessed this penalty for any underdeliveries outside the 10% tolerance for trades that take place from July 25 -30 for June imbalances.\nPlease call me if you have questions regarding this new G-IMB calculation. \nThanks. \nMary \nmreid@socalgas.com \nph (213) 244-3898 \nfx  (213) 244-3897 \n <<RG-3305.PDF>>  <<G-IMB-S2.PDF>> \n\n - RG-3305.PDF \n - G-IMB-S2.PDF",

    "Body": "Louise:\n\nPlease find the attached presentation that Jean, Don and I came by to discuss with you.  I know you are up to your eyes in credit issues, so we can talk about this when you get a chance.\n\nWe wanted to review the impact of the merger on Bridgeline.  Specifically, the potential benefits for putting in place an asset management structure for BHLP.   Dynegy has expressed interest in commercially managing these assets and Enron would to, if we would not have to pay an excessive fee to do so.   Jean's initial analysis indicates that Bridgeline is currently undervaluing the accrual value of the pipe and over-valuing trading.  We may be able to use this fact to our advantage in establishing a \"low\" asset management fee to pay to Bridgeline.\n\nIn addition, we may be able to reduce our deployed capital by selling the accrual value in BHLP to an MLP who is willing to pay a premium for stable cash/earnings.  The MLP could be one of Enron's (e.g. Northern Boarder, EOTT), or a Chev/Tex MLP (?), or even a 3rd party MLP.  The deciding factor should be the value the MLP is willing to pay for the earnings stream.\n\nWe have continued to discuss this with the Chev/Tex board members who remain interested in evaluating the benefits of this structure.  In their view, the Dynegy/Enron merger is a positive fact because it removes the Dynegy vs. Enron competition.\n\nWhen you get a chance we can talk.\n\nBrian",

(PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric and Edison \nInternational (EIX) unit Southern California Edison next week to a level \nshort of speculative status, and set strict terms for what it would consider \na favorable ruling by regulators on Jan. 4. \n \n  \n\"Moody's will continue to review for possible downgrade the ratings of \nSouthern California Edison Company and its parent, Edison International, and \nthe ratings of Pacific Gas and Electric Company and its parent, PG&E \nCorporation, and may take additional rating action next week prior to the \nJanuary 4th meeting,\" Moody's said. \"However, it is not anticipated at this \npoint that any rating action taken prior to the January 4th meeting would \nresult in the ratings of the utilities or their respective parents falling \nbelow investment grade.\" \n     \n\nSouthern California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric have lost a combined $8 \nbillion since May buying wholesale power at prices that far exceed the fixed \nrates they're allowed to charge their customers. \n\n\nBetween one-third and one-half of that figure is offset by profits from power \nplants the utilities still own, but the net losses are substantial and \nmounting. Both utilities have said they soon will become unable to continue \nbuying power for their customers if the situation persists. \n\n\nRatings agency Standard & Poor's warned Wednesday that both utilities face \nimminent default and a downgrading of their debt ratings to junk-bond status \nunless California officials acted immediately to raise rates and restore the \nutilities to liquidity. \n\n\nOn Thursday, the California Public Utilities Commission agreed rate hikes \nwere needed. \n\n\n\"We believe that retail rates in California must rise,\" the commission said \nin a written statement. \"It is our intent to maintain the utilities' access \nto capital on reasonable terms.\" \n\n\nBut the commission deferred a final ruling on rates until Jan. 4, pending \nhearings on the matter scheduled for next week. \n\n\nStandard & Poor's wasn't immediately available to comment on the decision. \n\n\nMoody's said Friday that the PUC's decision was a \"necessary first step\" in \nrestoring the utilities to financial viability. Comments by the PUC and other \nofficials indicated their desire to maintain the utilities' investment-grade \nstatus, Moody's said. \n\n\nBut Moody's set strict terms for what must come out of the PUC's Jan. 4 \nmeeting if the utilities are to avoid being downgraded to speculative status. \n\n\n\"Specifically, at that meeting, the utilities need to obtain the right to \nimmediately raise rates by a sizeable amount and must obtain the unquestioned \nand unambiguous ability to recover past and future wholesale procurement \ncosts,\" Moody's said. \"The failure by the CPUC to act in a prompt and \nconstructive way around these two issues could result in the utilities' \nratings being downgraded to below investment grade.\" \n\n\nSuch a downgrade would hurt the utilities' ability to fund power purchases \nand day-to-day operations, Moody's said. \n\n\n-By Andrew Dowell, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-4430; \nandrew.dowell@dowjones.com\n\n \n \n\n \n   \nArticle 2   Next Article  Previous Article   Return to Headlines \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \nPOWER POINTS: Calif Utils Won't Fail; Competition Will  \nBy Mark Golden  \n \n  \n12/22/2000  \nDow Jones Energy Service  \n \n \n \n(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)  \n \n  \n  \nA Dow Jones Newswires Column <~> \nNEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Fans of the movie \"Erin Brockovich\" have been tempted \nto fantasize about executives from California's two main investor-owned \nutilities, PG&E Corp. (PCG) and Edison International (EIX), heading to \nbankruptcy court. \n \n  \nDream on. \n\nTrue, this week the utilities didn't get either of the two things they need \nto escape the astronomically expensive spot market for electricity in \nCalifornia: a rate increase and long-term contracts with independent \ngenerators at prices they can afford under new rates. With lending sources \nvirtually dry, both utilities have said they are about to run out of the cash \nneeded to continue buying electricity in the spot market. \n\n\nBut hearings on a rate increase are scheduled to resume next week followed by \nthe California Public Utilities Commission vote on Jan. 4, and long-term \ncontract negotiations are to resume Jan. 3. \n\n\nBoth negotiations are likely to succeed in keeping the companies afloat \nbecause almost all parties would lose with the utilities under Chapter 11 \nprotection and because the price to save the utilities isn't that high. The \nrate increase decision was postponed Thursday because California Governor \nGray Davis and his CPUC are trying to give the corporations only what they \nneed to survive and not a penny more. If Davis succeeds - he is insisting on \nan independent audit of the holding companies and all subsidiaries - \nshareholders can expect to see their dividends cut. \n\n\nSorting out the finances of the $21 billion PG&E, which is the 73rd largest \nU.S. company, and $10 billion Edison International must be daunting. \n\n\nBut here are the basics: First, the utilities have to get out of the spot \nmarket. SCE charges residential and small commercial customers 12 cents a \nkilowatt-hour, of which 6.6 cents - or $66 a megawatt-hour - goes for \nelectricity. The rest covers transmission and distribution, some other costs \nand the utility's profit. \n\n\nIn the day-ahead and spot market, where SCE has been buying almost half the \npower it needs, the utility has been paying about $350/MWh. Rates, obviously, \nwon't be tripled so that SCE can continue to buy power in the spot market. \n\n\nBut the company can purchase five-year supply contracts at about $78/MWh \ncurrently, which it could do with a mere half-cent increase in rates. Since \nthe company is already making plenty of money on the coal-fired and nuclear \ngenerators that it owns, a half-cent increase on all the electricity it sells \ncould be applied to all of its outside purchasing, which comes to an extra \n$10 a megawatt-hour. \n\n\nEdison International is in a more dire immediate cash situation because the \nutility is two-thirds of the parent company, but Pacific Gas & Electric faces \na more difficult situation operationally. PG&E gets only 5.4 cents/KWh, or \n$54/MWh, from customers for electricity, while wholesale prices in northern \nCalifornia are more expensive than in southern California. Finally, PG&E has \nto buy about two-thirds of the power it needs in the wholesale market, \ncompared to SCE's 50%, because it sold off more of its power plants, as \ndictated by deregulation legislation, more quickly than SCE. \n\n\nStill, PG&E could pick up five-year supply contracts at about $83/MWh. A \ntwo-cent increase to its basic rate of 10 cents would give PG&E $30 more per \nmegawatt-hour - or $85/MWh - to spend on power purchases. \n\n\nBut a 20% increase may not be necessary. The governor's staff needs to find \nout the details on the substantial long-term deals PG&E had the foresight to \nsign back in October. Those deals were done at less than $55/MWh, and they \nkick in Jan. 1. \n\n\nThe governor's staff may also look at the unexpectedly high profits from \nSCE's and PG&E's nuclear power plants. The utilities have cut costs at the \nplants, so instead of making just 6% return on capital, the utilities have \nbeen getting a net gain of 30% on nuclear revenues, according to Bob \nFinkelstein of The Utilities Reform Network. If the utilities say \nderegulation decisions such as the rate freeze must be reexamined because \nthey are bankrupting the utilities, then, TURN says, the deregulation \ndecisions that have resulted in unexpected gains for the utilities should be \nlooked at, too. \n\n\nNevertheless, retail competition in California is dead for another five \nyears. The utilities get their modest rate increases with the insistence that \nthey lock up their needed supplies under long-term contracts. The contracts \nwill be approved by the CPUC, which means the utilities are guaranteed to be \npaid for the costs even if wholesale power prices fall below $80/MWh in three \nto four years, as expected. \n\n\nThe only way to ensure that the utilities get paid is to add a new \n\"non-bypassable\" transition cost to customer bills for five years, which \nmeans that even if a customer chooses an alternate power supplier, they will \nstill be sending money back to PG&E and Edison to pay for this year's \ndebacle. \n\n\nThe current non-bypassable charges, which are scheduled to end in March 2002, \nare what has killed retail competition since 1997. Competitors can't offer \nmuch in the way of savings, so almost nobody bothers to switch. \n\n\nElectricity traders and regulators wonder why the utilities keep buying so \nmuch power at the last minute through the Independent System Operator, which \nwill pay almost anything to keep the lights on. Right now, the ISO is paying \n$700/MWh for power that readily could have been bought Thursday for $400/MWh. \n\n\nThis practice over the past six months has run up Edison's debt to a \nprojected $2.3 billion at the end of December and PG&E's to $4 billion. \n(Edison overstates its real losses by 50%; PG&E, by 33%.) \n\n\nSo, for about $6 billion dollars, the utilities will get a rate increase and \nfour more years of protection from competition in their $20 billion business. \n\n\nThese guys are good. \n\n\nWas all this intentional? Go ask Erin Brockovich. \n\n\n-By Mark Golden, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-4604; mark.golden@dowjones.com\n\n \n \n\n \n   \nArticle 3   Next Article  Previous Article   Return to Headlines \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \nIndustry Watchers Confident About Rate Increase for California Utilities  \n \n \n  \n12/22/2000  \nDow Jones Business News  \n \n \n \n(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)  \n \n  \n  \nNEW YORK -- Some observers now believe that troubled California utilities \nEdison International and PG&E Corp. will get some relief at the start of the \nnew year after state regulators at least opened the door to electricity-rate \nincreases the two utilities said they need to stay in business. \nMany expect the California Public Utility Commission to authorize a rate \nincrease at a scheduled Jan. 4 meeting. ABN Amro Inc. analyst Daniel Ford was \nso optimistic he upgraded Edison shares to \"buy\" from \"hold.\" \n \n  \nShares of the two companies, which own the state's largest utilties, hit \n52-week lows Thursday. In midday trading Friday on the New York Stock \nExchange, PG&E (PCG), which owns Pacific Gas & Electric, was up $1.06, or 6%, \nto $19.31 while Edison International (EIX), parent of Southern California \nEdison, was flat at $14.94. \n\nOn Thursday, the California PUC tried to reassure jittery credit markets that \nthey won't let the state's big utilities go broke. Still they stopped short \nof ordering the kind of immediate relief utilities and their lenders want: \nrate increases big enough to cover exploding wholesale power costs in the \nstate's deregulated energy market. \n\n\nInstead, the California PUC ordered audits of utility records and scheduled \nhearings for next week, needed to provide a legal basis for eliminating a \nrate freeze that has protected most consumers from spiraling wholesale power \ncosts. \n\n\nSoaring power costs in supply-short California have produced a political \ncrisis in the state, which four years ago led the nation in deregulating its \npower industry. Wholesale electricity for delivery Sunday and Monday in the \nWest sold for $200 to $400 a megawatt-hour Thursday, about 10 times its \nyear-ago level. \n\n\nEdison Internaitonal's Southern California Edison unit and PG&E's Pacific Gas \nand Electric Co. have said they are more than $8 billion in debt due to the \nprice they must pay for electricity and the inability to pass on the higher \ncosts to consumers due to a state-mandated freeze. Between one-third and \none-half of that figure is offset by profits from power plants the utilities \nstill own in the state, but the net losses are substantial and mounting. \n\n\nBoth utilities have said they soon will become unable to continue buying \npower for their customers if the situation persists.

(PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric and Edison International \n(EIX) unit Southern California Edison will be able to sustain the mounting \ncosts of buying wholesale power for their customers. \n\nRatings agency Standard & Poor's warned Wednesday that both utilities face \nimminent default and a downgrading of their debt ratings to junk-bond status \nunless California officials acted immediately to raise rates and restore the \nutilities to liquidity. \n\n\nOn Thursday, the California Public Utilities Commission agreed rate hikes \nwere needed. \n\n\n\"We believe that retail rates in California must rise,\" the commission said \nin a written statement. \"It is our intent to maintain the utilities' access \nto capital on reasonable terms.\" \n\n\nBut the commission deferred a final ruling on rates until Jan. 4, pending \nhearings on the matter scheduled for next week. \n\n\nThe utilities welcomed the possibility of a rate hike, but expressed concerns \nthat the commission hadn't acted decisively enough. \n\n\n\"This is a significant change in the commission's approach,\" said PG&E Corp. \nspokesman Shawn Cooper. \"The real question is whether the action they are \ntaking today will inspire confidence in the financial community to allow us \nto continue to provide power to our customers.

Wholesale electricity for delivery Sunday and \nMonday in the West sold for $200-$400 a megawatt-hour Thursday, about 10 \ntimes its year-ago level. \n\n\nThe utilities have lost a combined $8 billion since May buying wholesale \npower at such prices, which far exceed the fixed rates they're allowed to \ncharge their customers. \n\n\nBetween one-third and one-half of that figure is offset by profits from power \nplants the utilities still own in the state, but the net losses are \nsubstantial and mounting. Both utilities have said they soon will become \nunable to continue buying power for their customers if the situation \npersists. \n\n\nSouthern California Edison, which said this week it won't be able to pay a \npower bill that comes due Jan. 4, said in a statement Thursday that it will \nsoon adopt a \"cash preservation\" plan that could involve layoffs and cuts in \noperations. Company executives were in talks with bankruptcy attorneys \nThursday to plan their next move, a Southern California Edison executive \nsaid. \n\n\nThe utilities' deteriorating creditworthiness has left some generators \nreluctant to supply power to California without guarantees they'll be paid. \nThe U.S. Department of Energy has issued an emergency order requiring power \nsuppliers in the West to sell uncommitted electricity to California on demand \nuntil Dec. 28. \n\n\nConsumer groups, which say the utilities are overstating their financial \nwoes, decried the PUC decision. \n\n\n\"The most disturbing part is this notion that rate increases are inevitable,\" \nsaid Michael Shames, spokesman for San Diego-based Utility Consumers Action \nNetwork. \n\n\nThe utilities were seeking rate increases of up to 30%. State officials were \nreluctant to accept anything beyond 10%, an amount analysts said is \ninsufficient. \n\n\nThe commission said it deferred its decision on the matter to create time for \nevidentiary hearings and an independent audit to determine how much of an \nincrease is needed. \n\n\nConsumer groups, however, were skeptical. \n\n\n\"It is clearly a sham procedural course that indicates the PUC has something \nin mind to do, but they need to claim they had a public process before doing \nit,\" said Bob Finkelstein, spokesman for The Utility Reform Network. \n\n\nThe Cambridge Energy Research Associates said Thursday that California faces \nanother three years of high electricity prices and possible blackouts, \nbecause the state's piecemeal response to the power crisis has discouraged \nthe development of new generating capacity. \n\n\n-By Andrew Dowell, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-4430; \nandrew.dowell@dowjones.com \n\n\n(Jason Leopold, Mark Golden and Jessica Berthold contributed to this article.)\n\n \n \n\n \n   \nArticle 7   Next Article  Previous Article   Return to Headlines \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \nSoCal Gas Inventories Low, But Interruptions Doubtful  \nBy Pat Maio  \n \n  \n12/22/2000  \nDow Jones News Service  \n \n \n \n(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)  \n \n  \n  \nOf DOW JONES NEWSWIRES <~> (This story was originally published late \nThursday.) <~> \nLOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- Unlike the almost daily threats of rolling \nblackouts from the electricity industry in California, the possibility of \nnatural gas interruptions is unlikely even though reserves are historically \nlow, said a company executive of Southern California Gas Co. \n \n  \nSoCal Gas is the gas distribution unit of San Diego-based Sempra Energy \n(SRE), and serves 5 million customers. \n\nReserves of natural gas stored in four underground rock formations scattered \nthroughout Southern California are at lower levels than what SoCal Gas \nnormally maintains, said Anne Smith, vice president of customer service and \nmarketing at SoCal Gas, in a phone interview with Dow Jones Newswires. \n\n\nSoCal Gas entered its winter season on Nov. 1 with 63 billion cubic feet of \ngas in storage, about 30 Bcf less than its previous heating seasons, Smith \nsaid. \n\n\nThe lower reserve levels are due to power plants in California siphoning out \nthe gas at unprecedented levels, she said. \n\n\nThe plants burn strictly gas, and are trying to meet the intense electrical \ndemand this winter after the state's certain source of power from hydro \ngenerators in the Pacific Northwest had evaporated. \n\n\nLack of rain in the region this year is to blame for the hydro cutbacks, \nSmith said. \n\n\nAs well, a cold snap in November, coupled with SoCal Gas's decision to buy \nless gas this past summer for reserves, didn't help matters. \n\n\nSmith isn't worried about the lower levels of gas in the company's storage \nareas, which can hold up to 105 Bcf. \n\n\nThe cold weather in November forced SoCal Gas to pull out of storage about 13 \nBcf in November, leaving a total of 50 Bcf, Smith said. \n\n\nThe stored gas is purchased as a hedge to protect the company from \nfluctuations in natural gas prices -- which this month have soared to as high \nas $60 per million British thermal units on the spot market. \n\n\nFor the most part, SoCal Gas imports its gas from out-of-state regions in \nTexas and New Mexico via pipelines owned by El Paso Natural Gas Co. (EPG) and \nEnron Corp.'s (ENE) Transwestern pipeline. \n\n\nEl Paso and Transwestern are keeping up with demand, and report that their \npipelines are filled to the near the brim. \n\n\nOver the past few weeks, Smith said it is pushing out through its system of \npipes about 3.45 Bcf to 3.5 Bcf of gas daily, to its customers. \n\n\n\"The way we see demand breakdown the last couple of weeks is generators using \nabout 1 Bcf a day, our core customers (4.8 million) about 1.5 Bcf and our \nnon-core\" about 1 Bcf, she said. The non-core customers -- which number about \n1,500 in total -- are industrial manufacturers who consume more than 250,000 \ntherms of gas annually, Smith said. \n\n\nIn comparison, a home averages about 600 therms. \n\n\nSmith's eyebrows have been raised by the rapid consumption of natural gas by \npower plants, which use the commodity to run turbines for electrical \ngeneration. \n\n\nHistorically electric power plants have consumed about 300 million to 400 \nmillion cubic feet a day of gas in SoCal Gas' service territory, she said. \n\n\n\"This is why we are seeing pipelines fuller than usual. There is continuing \ndemand by the electric generators,\" she said. \"This is basically an increase \nin demand for gas that has contributed to the national picture of why prices \n(for gas) have gone up this year. Demand has outpaced production capacity,\" \nSmith explained. \n\n\nA growing economy starved for electricity to run its Internet systems or \nmanufacturing businesses, have contributed to the reasons why gas prices have \nsoared this month, she said. \n\n\nPower plant owners have passed along these higher gas costs to the utilities \nwhere they sell their electricity. \n\n\nThis is partially why PG&E Corp.'s Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Edison \nInternational's (EIX) Southern California Edison face financial insolvency \ntoday. \n\n\nThey are having to borrow billions of dollars to pay for this higher-priced \nelectricity as part of the state's complex deregulation plan. \n\n\nThe power plants are owned by out-of-state companies like AES Corp. (AES), \nCalpine Corp. (CPN) and Duke Energy Corp. (DUK). \n\n\nThe threat of rolling blackouts has several causes. \n\n\nSome power plants run around the clock -- gobbling up the natural gas at a \nrapid pace. But others have temporarily been shut down because environmental \nlaws prohibit them from emitting certain levels of pollutants annually. \n\n\nSoCal Gas has managed to keep its gas costs relatively low by buying gas for \nits core customers on long-term contracts at fixed prices. \n\n\nThis helps to insulate the company from price spikes on gas delivered to its \nsystem at the California and Arizona and Nevada borders. \n\n\nBy buying gas this way, SoCal Gas was able to set a fixed charge of $6.53 per \nMMBTU for its 4.8 million core customers in the month of December. A new \nprice is set to be established next week for January. \n\n\n\"We hope it holds steady in January,\" said Smith. \"We are doing everything we \ncan.\" \n\n\n-By Pat Maio, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3776; \n\n\npatrick.maio@dowjones.com\n\n \n \n\n \n   \nArticle 8   Next Article  Previous Article   Return to Headlines \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \nS&P:Diverse Holdings Insulate Generators From Calif Risk  \n \n \n  \n12/22/2000  \nDow Jones Energy Service  \n \n \n \n(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)  \n \n  \n  \n(This article was originally published Thursday) <~> \nNEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Independent generators selling power into California \nface \"extremely serious counterparty credit concerns,\" but the threat to \ntheir financial positions from a default by one of the state's utilities is \nmitigated by their positions in other power markets, Standard & Poor's said \nThursday. \n \n  \nThe ratings agency affirmed its double-B-plus corporate credit and senior \nunsecured debt ratings for one of those generators, Calpine Corp. (CPN), and \nindicated that the positions of a number of other generators were similarly \nstable. \n\nStandard & Poor's, without commenting on ratings, said those generators \ninclude Dynegy Inc. (DYN), The Williams Cos. (WMB), Reliant Energy Inc. \n(REI), Southern Energy Inc. (SOE) and NRG Energy Inc. (NRG). \n\n\n\"Each company has a diverse asset portfolio that mitigates exposure to any \nsingle market, such as California,\" S&P said. \"Standard & Poor's has \nconcluded that the developers with merchant exposure to the California market \nhave sufficient financial liquidity to sustain long-term disruptions to their \nmarkets.\" \n\n\nS&P also said the generators have generally incorporated conservative pricing \nassumptions well below California's current market prices. \n\n\nThe generators' main counterparties in California - PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit \nPacific Gas & Electric and Edison International (EIX) unit Southern \nCalifornia Edison - have lost a combined $8 billion buying wholesale power at \nprices far higher than they are allowed to charge their customers. \n\n\nBetween one-third and one-half of those losses are offset by the utilities' \nown profits from generating power in the state, but they are still \nsubstantial and mounting. Both utilities have said they face a serious \nliquidity crisis. \n\n\nS&P said Thursday that both companies face imminent default unless California \nofficials immediately come up with a way to correct the imbalance between \ntheir buying and selling price for power, and said it would likely downgrade \nthe utilities' debt ratings to junk-bond status even if they avoid \nbankruptcy. \n\n\nThe California Public Utilities Commission met Thursday and opened the door \nto rate hikes, but deferred a final decision to its Jan. 4 meeting. \n\n\nS&P wasn't available to comment on its outlook for PG&E and SCE or the \ngenerators following the PUC's decision. \n\n\nAbout 1,284 net megawatts of Calpine's total 4,900 net megawatts of \ngeneration is exposed to California counterparty risk, S&P said. Nonetheless, \nonly about $400 million of Calpine's approximate $2 billion revenues for 2000 \nhave seen exposure to California's energy markets, the ratings agency said. \nCalpine's receivables total only about $75 million, S&P said. \n\n\n\"The affirmation comes during a period of extremely serious counterparty \ncredit concerns for generators selling into the California power markets,\" \nS&P said of its decision regarding Calpine. \n\n\n-By Andrew Dowell, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-4430; \nandrew.dowell@dowjones.com\n\n \n \n\n \n   \nArticle 9   Next Article  Previous Article   Return to Headlines \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n \nChapter 11 Filing May Give Calif Utils Breathing Room  \n \nOf DOW JONES NEWSWIRES  \n  \n12/22/2000  \nDow Jones Energy Service  \n \n \n \n(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)  \n \n  \n  \n(This article was originally published Thursday) <~> \nBy Jason Leopold \n \n  \nLOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--If two of California's largest utilities file for \nChapter 11 bankruptcy protection, a move they said this week was possible, it \nmay give the companies some breathing room to allow for a much needed \ninternal reorganization, according to one California bankruptcy attorney. \n\n\"What Chapter 11 ultimately does is it allows a company to reorganize,\" said \nLarry Peitzman, an attorney with the Southern California-based law firm of \nPeitzman, Glassman and Whegg. \"The whole purpose is to come up with a plan to \nallow the company to service and pay back creditors and shareholders as much \nas possible.\" \n\n\nWhile in bankruptcy, a judge can order the state to raise the utilities \nretail electricity rates if that would help the company generate revenue to \npay its creditors, Peitzman said. \n\n\nPeitzman, who has worked on many large company bankruptcy cases in \nCalifornia, said if PG&E Corp. unit (PCG) Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and \nEdison International unit (EIX) Southern California Edison file for \nbankruptcy, the companies will be given an injunction by a court that will \nprevent creditors from seizing the utilities assets, collecting money or \nfiling a lawsuit against the companies. \n\n\n\"Another reason to file for bankruptcy protection is the companies wouldn't \nbe forced to pay pre-bankruptcy debts if they have run up enormous bills,\" \nPeitzman said. \n\n\nExecutives at both PG&E and SoCal Edison said they may be forced to file for \nbankruptcy protection because of a combined $8 billion debt in excess \nwholesale power costs and the inability under state law to pass those costs \non to rate payers. However, between one-half and one-third of that money has \nbeen paid into accounts held by the utilities to collect profits from the \ngenerators they still own. \n\n\nThe utilities were hoping for an immediate rate hike Thursday by the state's \nPublic Utilities Commission, but commissioners said it would first hold \nevidentiary hearings and conduct an internal audit of the companies. A rate \nincrease is still at least two weeks off, the commission said at its meeting. \n\n  \n   Utilities Can Conduct Business While In Bankruptcy  \n   \n\nPeitzman said that while in bankruptcy, the companies could operate as a \n\"debtor in possession,\" which means the companies have the authority to \nconduct business as usual without the consent of bankruptcy court. But if the \ncompanies were to try and secure a loan, the loan would have to be approved \nby a judge. \n\n\nAlthough most Chapter 11 bankruptcy cases \"can't survive,\" Peitzman said, the \nstate's two largest utilities - with millions of customers - may be an \nexception. \n\n\n\"Inevitably they are going to continue to owe money because of the constant \nshortfall they pay in (electricity costs) and what they charge their \ncustomers,\" the attorney said. \"But the bigger the company, the more likely \nthe company will survive. It will be devastating to lose such large \ncorporations.\" \n\n\nIf the companies fail to survive a Chapter 11 filing, the utilities' assets \nwould be liquidated to pay off their creditors, Peitzman said. \n\n\nIn a Chapter 11 filing, PG&E and SoCal Edison would put their creditors in \ndifferent classes and determine how much under the dollar each one would get \npaid, Peitzman said. \n\n\n\"It can be as much as possible or less than 100 cents on the dollar,\" he \nsaid. \n\n\nIn addition, any contracts that either companies held before a potential \nbankruptcy filing would have to be honored regardless if the company can \nfulfill its financial obligations to its counterpart, Peitzman said. \n\n\n\"That's one of the other benefits,\" he said. \"It's called executory \ncontracts, which generally means both parties have material operations that \nhave yet to be performed. It may be long-term contracts and the company would \nbe able to enforce the other part to continue doing business. The other party \ncan't refuse to do business because of a stay.\" \n\n\nBankruptcy can last as long as a judge allows it, Peitzman said, pointing to \nthe Eastern Airlines bankruptcy case in the early 1980s which lasted for \nyears. \n\n\nNeither company has indicated whether it will actually file for bankruptcy, \nbut SoCal Edison said in a filing with the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission Tuesday that it may not be able to pay its January power bill if \nits retail rates are not immediately raised. \n\n\n-By Jason Leopold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3874; \njason.leopold@dowjones.com\n\n \n \n\n \n   \nArticle 10   Next Article  Previous Article   Return to Headlines \n \n \n \n \nNational Desk; Section A  \nTrying to Shore Up Utilities, California Plans Rate Increase  \nBy LAURA M.

The agency is expected to comment on the commission's action \nsoon. \n\nGov. Gray Davis has been meeting this week with utility executives and \nconsumer advocates to come to an agreement on the size of a rate increase. \nMr. Davis, a Democrat, is also seeking the advice of financial experts, \nincluding Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, whom he is \nexpected to meet with next week. \n\n\nSome people close to those discussions suggested that 10 percent would be a \npalatable rate increase, but the utilities are asking for more. The \ncommission will hold hearings next week, and just how much consumers will \nhave to pay should be decided by Jan. 4. \n\n\nFour years ago, California agreed to deregulate its utilities with the hope \nthat competition would lower rates for households and businesses. But this \nyear, prices for wholesale electricity and natural gas have skyrocketed, \nforcing utilities to incur costs of more than $8 billion that they cannot \npass to consumers because rates are frozen until 2002. \n\n\nIn recent weeks, the utilities have tried to make a case that, without rate \nincreases, service to consumers is threatened. John Bryson, chief executive \nof Edison International, the parent company of Southern California Edison, \nhas taken the unusual step of warning consumers in television and newspaper \nadvertisements in Southern California and in Sacramento that blackouts are \ninevitable unless order is imposed. \n\n\nIn response to the announcement by the commission today, Southern California \nEdison said it expected additional cost cutting and measures to preserve cash \nsoon. \n\n\nBut not all the commissioners believed that today's announcement would be \nenough to placate financial analysts and investors, many of whom buy utility \nstocks because they are perceived to be less risky than, for example, \nInternet stocks. Analysts have recently downgraded the stocks of both Pacific \nGas and Electric and California Edison, which are trading near 52-week lows, \nover fears about California's energy woes. \n\n\n''When I look at the newspapers and peruse the Internet I get the decided \nimpression that Wall Street has spoken,'' said Richard Bilas, a commissioner. \n''I don't know if this decision goes far enough.''\n\n \n \n\n \n   \nArticle 11   Next Article  Previous Article   Return to Headlines \n \n \n \n \n \nFitch Comments On California Electric Utilities  \n \n \n  \n12/22/2000  \nBusiness Wire  \n \n \n \n(Copyright (c) 2000, Business Wire)  \n \n  \n  \nCHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dec. 22, 2000--Fitch views the California Public \nUtilities Commission's (CPUC) interim decision to initiate proceedings to \nconsider raising retail rates as just one of the steps necessary to salvage \ncredit quality for the state's two largest utilities, Southern California \nEdison (SCE) and Pacific Gas and Electric Company (Pac Gas). The CPUC is \nexpected to reach a decision on rate increases and recovery mechanisms during \nthe first week of January, at which time Fitch will assess the appropriate \nratings for these companies. The outstanding issue is whether rate increases \nwill sufficiently offset high wholesale power prices being paid by the \ncompanies. \nThe companies' securities ratings are likely to weaken, unless 1) full \nrecovery is provided for the large monies paid by the utilities above \nexisting retail rates and 2) price stability is ensured for the regional \nmarket. The utilities are unable to tap new credit until the rate decision is \nexecuted. They do have, however, sufficient cash and existing credit to \nsupport them through the decision period of the first week in January. If a \nsuitable rate structure is passed by the CPUC at that time, the utilities' \nbanks would be more likely to consider additional funding. \n \n  \nLiquidity will remain strained, however, to the extent that regional power \nprices remain high. While Energy Secretary Richardson has ordered certain \npower producers to sell into the California market, wholesale prices remain \nhigh and are above retail rates. No additional federal action has been taken. \n\nThe CPUC's decision in early January is not expected to completely resolve \nthe utilities' future. Given the large costs incurred and numerous \nconstituent groups affected, Fitch envisions a longer-term scenario of \nconsecutive rate increases associated with a fundamental overhaul of \nCalifornia's power market. In conjunction with the governor's active \ninvolvement, the California legislature is evaluating potential actions to \nrestructure the state's power situation. Legislative action remains possible \nover the next three months, and could impact debt ratings. \n\n\nThe Rating Watch Negative designation remains in place for Pac Gas, SCE and \nits parent, Edison International. The current ratings are: \n\n  \n\nSouthern California Edison: \n\n\n-- First Mortgage Bonds,`A'; \n\n\n-- Senior Unsecured Debt,`A-`; \n\n\n-- Preferred Stock,`BBB+'; \n\n\n-- Commercial Paper,`F2'. \n\n\nEdison International: \n\n\n-- Senior Unsecured Debt,`A-`; \n\n\n-- Preferred Stock,`BBB+'; \n\n\n-- Commercial Paper,`F2'. \n\n\nPacific Gas and Electric Company: \n\n\n-- First Mortgage Bonds,`A-`; \n\n\n-- Preferred Stock,`BBB+'. \n\n\nEIX's ratings are also on Rating Watch Negative as approximately half of its \nconsolidated cash flow is provided by SCE. Fitch does not rate the securities \nof Pac Gas' parent holding company, PG&E. \n\n\nThe ratings of San Diego Gas & Electric Company (SDG&E) are not pressured to \nthe extent of the utilities described above. Unlike the other utilities, \nSDG&E is operating under a legislatively-imposed rate ceiling for residential \nand small commercial loads. Its legislation also permits a balancing account \nto accumulate uncollected power procurement costs. Less liquidity pressure \nalso exists at SDG&E due to its strong financial fundamentals (senior \nunsecured debt rated 'AA-'). Fitch has a Rating Outlook Negative designation \non SDG&E's ratings due to potential increases in leverage while power \nprocurement costs are high.

In our view, that mandate \nmeans that we must avoid continuing <~> conditions that may jeopardize the \nutilities' creditworthiness and their <~> ability to continue to procure \nenergy on behalf of customers. Therefore, <~> we believe that retail rates in \nCalifornia must begin to rise. It is our <~> intent to maintain the \nutilities' access to capital on reasonable terms. <~> We recognize that this \nwill require that we act expeditiously to address <~> the new FERC-imposed \nreality of unlimited wholesale prices.\" \n \n  \nNevertheless, SCE underscored that any solution to the current crisis \nrequires prompt, meaningful and final action by the commission ending the \nrate freeze, providing for the recovery of procurement costs, and increasing \nrates to a level that will restore the creditworthiness of California's \ninvestor- owned utilities. \n\nSCE added that it anticipated announcing additional cost-reduction and \ncash-preservation measures in the near term that would be necessary to \nprotect the company's financial integrity while maintaining customer service. \n\n\nAn Edison International company, Southern California Edison is one of the \nnation's largest electric utilities, serving a population of more than 11 \nmillion via 4.3 million customer accounts in a 50,000-square-mile service \narea within central, coastal and Southern California.\n\n \n/CONTACT: Southern California Edison, Corporate Communications, 626-302-2255/ \n19:24 EST  \n \n\n \n   \nArticle 13   Next Article  Previous Article   Return to Headlines \n \n \n \n \n \nAmbac Financial Group has Insured Exposure to Southern California Edison and \nPacific Gas & Electric  \n \n \n  \n12/21/2000  \nBusiness Wire  \n \n \n \n(Copyright (c) 2000, Business Wire)  \n \n  \n  \nNEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dec. 21, 2000--Ambac Financial Group, Inc.

All Rights Reserved.  \n \n  \n  \nPacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) and Southern California Edison (SoCalEd) were \ndisappointed Thursday in their bid to gain permission for a rate increase to \ngo into effect Jan. 1.\nState regulators denied the utilities' request that they take immediate \naction to approve the rate increases, saying that the requests are \n\"premature.\" \n \n  \nWhile regulators did not outright reject the utilities petitions, they \ndeclined to implement the remedies requested until the cases can be reviewed \nfurther at a later date. \n\nThe president of the Public Utilities Commission (PUC), Loretta Lynch, issued \ntwo rulings at the commission's meeting Thursday \"suspend[ing] the schedule \nin the Rate Stabilization Plan applications recently filed by [PG&E and \nSoCalEd].\" \n\n\nBoth utilities filed papers separately with the PUC stating that they had \nfulfilled the criteria set for ending a rate freeze imposed on them under \nCalifornia's electric industry restructuring statute. The law allowed for a \ntransition period, during which the utilities were to pay off any \"stranded \ncosts\" related to investments in generation assets. \n\n\nBy keeping prices frozen at 1993 levels, legislators and utility \nrepresentatives who expected wholesale power prices would fall, thought the \nmeasure would give the companies a chance to pay off those costs by a March \n31, 2002, deadline. Instead, prices shot up and the utilities were left with \nthe responsibility to supply power to their customers while paying the \ndifference between high wholesale prices and lower retail rates. \n\n\nClaiming \"undercollections\" totaling over $5 billion between them, the \nutilities say they want the price freeze lifted and retail rates increased. \nLast month, SoCalEd asked for permission for a 10% increase and PG&E for a \n22% increase in its rates.

I have drafted as though TW is issuing the preferred, for tax reasons that may cost ENE +/- $30 million per year we want Newco 1 to issue.\n3.  I am not convinced we want to offer same conversion terms as we did Dynegy.  Areas to think about removing or changing are (i) do we offer the makewhole and (ii) should we replace all \"repurchase\" scenarios with a redemption structure to avoid the whole change of control issue.  \n4.

Under the new system, imbalances in the schedule can result in SIGNIFICANT financial implications. For example, we had an imbalance of 18 MW for HE 21 on 10/29/01 which resulted in a $60,000 penalty. We need to work together with GENCO to ensure we meet their requirements on an hour to hour basis.\n\nSteps to take to facilitate this process:\n\n1. Continuously check with GENCO at the top of each hour to verify if generation is required.\n2. Complete all transmission requests, OATI tags, in time, to not disrupt the MDEA's needs\n3. Continuously search out new resources for electricity to help in case of emergency.\n4. Become very familiar with EES transmission, how it works, how to move from point to point, restrictions, time constraints, etc.\n5. Be aware of the marketing companies who own generation in EES control area. i.e.. Calpine, PGET, Dynegy, etc.\n\n\nAny questions, let me know\n\nMG",

    "Body": "To All Employees:\n\nThis morning Enron took a series of actions designed to stabilize our situation and preserve the value in our businesses:\n\n-- We filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Contrary to popular belief, this does not mean we are out of business. What it does mean is that we have entered into a court-supervised process by which we can continue to operate most of our businesses, reorganize our finances, and explore various strategic, operational and financial alternatives, including the sale of non-core assets, in an orderly manner.\n\n\n-- In connection with our filing for Chapter 11 reorganization, Enron is in active discussions with leading financial institutions for debtor-in-possession (DIP) financing and expects to complete these discussions shortly. Upon the completion and court approval of these arrangements, the new funding will be available immediately on an interim basis to supplement Enron's existing capital and help the Company fulfill obligations associated with operating its business, including its employee payroll and payments to vendors for goods and services provided on or after today's filing.\n\n-- We filed a lawsuit against Dynegy, alleging breach of contract and other causes of action for Dynegy's wrongful termination of our proposed merger. We are asking the court for damages of not less than $10 billion.\n\n-- We also announced this morning that we are in active discussions with various leading financial institutions about providing financial support to recapitalize and revitalize the company's wholesale energy trading operations under a new ownership structure. As contemplated, this recapitalized entity will be staffed with people from Enron's current wholesale energy trading team, and will conduct counterparty transactions through EnronOnline.\n\nThese are the first steps in a strategic restructuring process that will allow Enron to meet its obligations to its creditors and preserve the value in our core wholesale energy trading business. From an operational standpoint, our energy businesses - including our pipelines, utilities and other energy assets - are conducting safe and normal operations around the world, and will continue to do so.\n\nAs you know, the second and unavoidable part of our restructuring is to improve our financial position by implementing a comprehensive cost-savings program. This will entail a significant reduction in our work force. This is painful for all of us and our goal is for as many of you as is possible to know where you stand by the end of the day Tuesday, though in some cases notification will take longer.\n\nFor our friends and colleagues who will lose their jobs as part of this process, you will remain on the company payroll for now. In addition, we will submit a severance pay plan to the Bankruptcy Court for approval. This approval must be received before we can begin paying severance benefits. We will be providing more information about this plan as soon as the Court has made its determination.\n\nI know these actions raise new questions about our company's future and what this means for each of us. Your business unit leader will be holding floor meetings on Monday to discuss these events with you. In addition, you can access a copy of the press release on  <http://home.enron.com/>. We will also have a Q&A and other materials for you on Monday.

Cambridge, Mass.-based Off Wall Street, led by analyst Mark Robe=\nrts, thinks Enron's 2001 earnings will fall 6 cents short of the consensus =\nestimate of $1.79. The firm also believes Enron stock should trade around $=\n30, nearly 50% below Wednesday's $59.20.  The firm's 26-page report, publis=\nhed May 6, highlights Enron's declining profitability and increasing levera=\nge and suggests that the company should trade on the same sort of multiple =\nas a trading firm like Goldman Sachs (GS :NYSE - news ), which has a 2001 p=\nrice-to-earnings ratio about half of Enron's 33 times. OWS also alleges tha=\nt Enron's earnings quality is poor and that key parts of its financial stat=\nements are confusing and opaque.  Houston-based Enron didn't comment by pub=\nlication time on elements of the report that Detox  sent the company. An en=\nergy analyst who is bullish on Enron's outlook says the OWS report contains=\n fundamental misunderstandings about the energy market and Enron's business=\n model, but he says the report does include some ground-breaking and valid =\ninsights. (The analyst's firm doesn't give stock recommendations.)  Economi=\nes of Scale Why care what Off Wall Street writes, compared with, say, analy=\nsts at Merrill Lynch (MER :NYSE - news )? For one, OWS has an excellent tra=\nck record. Particularly sweet was 2000, when the tech stocks it had bashed =\ncame crashing down. It has also shown itself to be well ahead of the curve,=\n recommending that clients sell e-tailer priceline.com (PCLN :Nasdaq - news=\n ) in June 1999, when faith in Internet stocks was at its blindest and thei=\nr prices at their most insane.      Pulling Back Enron retreats after long =\nrally   Enron, with its domination of a burgeoning energy market, annual re=\nvenue of over $100 billion and impressive earnings growth, can hardly be ra=\nnked alongside the likes of priceline. But OWS thinks Enron is set for a pr=\necipitous drop nonetheless. Why?  OWS's main beef is that key profitability=\n measures are in decline. Margins on Enron's pretax operating earnings (whi=\nch the company's earnings releases call IBIT, or income before interest, ta=\nxes and other items) are falling. Total IBIT of $795 million in the first q=\nuarter amounted to only 1.59% of the $50 billion in revenue for the period,=\n compared with a 2.08% margin in the fourth quarter and 4.75% in the year-e=\narlier period. Revenue in the first quarter was nearly quadrupled from the =\nyear-earlier period, yet IBIT rose only 27%. This shrinkage is due to lower=\n-margin trading income making up an increasingly large share of Enron's rev=\nenue base.  OWS thus calculates that for the remainder of 2001 Enron needs =\nto generate an extra $2.1 billion in revenue for each additional penny it m=\nakes over its 2000 EPS of $1.47 to reach analysts' expectation of $1.79.  T=\nhe energy analyst counters that OWS apparently hasn't grasped how Enron can=\n continue to increase earnings even when margins shrink. It does so simply =\nby increasing volumes as the energy market balloons in size. In other words=\n, margins may decline, but since revenues are so much higher, earnings stil=\nl go up. Illustrating this, first-quarter 2001 EPS of 49 cents was 23% ahea=\nd of the year-ago figure, even though the IBIT margin shrank by 3.2 percent=\nage points. The analyst thinks Enron will make $1.82 per share in 2001.  Gr=\nowing On You In addition, the huge growth in the energy market that has so =\nhelped Enron is likely to continue for several years, according to the anal=\nyst. He notes that roughly 75% of the electricity available in the U.S. sti=\nll isn't traded in a market. \"Eventually it will be part of a competitive e=\nnvironment, but it'll take five to 10 years,\" says the analyst. And he beli=\neves the extreme volatility in energy-related commodities that has also ben=\nefited Enron will exist for longer than OWS projects.  Still, OWS's point o=\nn profitability is bolstered by other profit measures. Return on capital (n=\net income as a percentage of equity plus debt) was 6.6% in 2000, down on 19=\n99's 6.9% and well below the 2000 returns on capital at Duke (DUK :NYSE - n=\news ) (11.8%), Dynegy (DYN :NYSE - news ) (12.1%) and even Goldman (8.9%). =\n Even Enron bulls will admit that its financials are hard to follow. For ex=\nample, it doesn't give a gross margin number for its wholesale services, or=\n trading, business, which accounts for 96% of revenue. But one area of the =\ncompany's financial statements registered with the Securities and Exchange =\nCommission that consistently bugs analysts is the part that describes Enron=\n's related party transactions, which are the deals it does with entities th=\nat have some sort of link to the firm. In fact, one of the related entities=\n that Enron has traded with is headed by Enron's CFO, Andrew Fastow. The en=\nergy analyst comments: \"Why are they doing this? It's just inappropriate.\" =\n The reason for maintaining these hard-to-follow related party deals has be=\nen a source of speculation. But OWS analysis shows how a sales of optical f=\niber to a related party may have been used to goose earnings in the second =\nquarter of 2000. Estimated profits from the so-called dark fiber (optical c=\nable without the gear to send data over it) transaction allowed Enron to be=\nat analysts' second-earnings earnings estimate by 2 cents a share, rather t=\nhan missing by 2 cents.  How soon before Wall Street follows Off Wall Stree=\nt on Enron?   =09",

My understanding of this is as follows:  In the event of bankruptcy, employees are guaranteed to be paid for work already completed up to an amount of $4650 (If the company were to file next week, this amount should be small since payday was today).  In addition, employees are paid for hours worked after bankruptcy at their normal salary or an amount the judge determines and such payments are not capped at $4650.  \n\n\n -----Original Message-----",

We want to encourage you to come to work.  We continue to consider every option available to us as a company; and unfortunately, restructuring through bankruptcy is one of those options.  Your continued efforts during these trying times are critical to the company as we go through this decision making process.\n\nI still cannot say with certainty if or when we will file for bankruptcy.  But you should be aware that, in general, the bankruptcy code provides protection for employee salaries and wages earned within 90 days of a petition filing to the extent of $4,650 per employee.  I want you to know that if we file a bankruptcy petition, we intend to seek approval by the bankruptcy court to exercise that protection immediately and pay you for your time worked prior to any petition filing according to our regular payroll practices.  Additionally, Enron would be obligated and will pay salaries and wages earned after a bankruptcy filing. For Enron, where our value is directly tied to our employees, making sure that we meet these obligations will be a high priority.\n\nWe are continuing to evaluate the ongoing resource needs of the company for each potential option we might pursue.  Of course, until we finalize those business decisions, we cannot make that determination.  I know that this prolonged process is agonizing for you.  I can only continue to assure you that we will notify you of your employment status as soon as we are able to do so.\n\nWhile terminated employees will tap into their own network of contacts as they look for new employment, we hope to do what we can to assist them.  We will tap into the contacts we have as a company to aid terminated employees in their job search.  We have already been in touch with several employers and many are interested in Enron alumni.  We will share more information on these efforts soon.\n\nI appreciate your continued patience and cooperation.\n\nKen"

    "Body": "Listened in on the analyst call this morning.  Here are my notes.  Did not yet have a chance to organize them, so they're simply in chronological order.\n\nThe call began with Watson, Bergstrom, and Whalley reading from prepared statements.  Watson spoke for c. 10 minutes, Bergstrom for 5, and Whalley spoke for perhaps 30 seconds.  Dynegy management was noticeably in control of the call.  Enron executives spoke when questions were directed to them.  \n\nSpecific points:\nEES will be a part of the new company.  \nEnron assets will be revalued at closing.  \nThe investment in Northern Natural takes the form of convertible preferred.  If the merger does not go through, Dynegy has the right to acquire Northern for 'very little' additional consideration.  If DYN terminates the merger and ENE 'has sufficient liquidity', ENE has right to repurchase the convertible preferred.  \nDebt/equity of combined company expected to be <45%.\nBoth companies will remain on RatingsWatch negative.  \nChevronTexaco will hold 169MM shares out of a total 650MM shares of the post-merger entity.  \nWatson reiterates that going forward, the new entity will be run with a focus on transparent and clear financial structure and disclosure, with a significant reduction in on- and off-balance-sheet leverage.  \nIn what was termed a \"new approach\", the new entity will be run with a focus on cash flow rather than earnings.  \nRumors that Dynegy did the deal because of an unhedged exposure to Enron are not true.  Dynegy owed Enron <$50MM.  \nLay says that Enron had other options, 'particularly financial'.\nAll of the discussion and activity has taken place over the last two weeks.\nLay acknowledges that the number for exposure to securities lawsuits may be 'pretty big', but that the companies feel they're able to appropriately value this exposure.\nLay says we have nothing else to hide, but internal investigation still under way.  \nLay:  had the SPEs been capitalized with perhaps $30MM more of risk capital, there would have been no question that they would have qualified for off-balance-sheet treatment and there would have been no need to restate earnings last week to reflect consolidation of the SPEs.\nDynegy says that 'several' internal investigations continue at Enron, and thus DYN/ENE cannot say with certainty that there's absolutely nothing else out there.\nDoty (Dynegy CFO) says that late last week, ENE had 'close to a billion' in cash.  \nOsprey will be unwound late next summer. Marlin will be unwound after closing.\nMany of the off-balance-sheet structures, including the credit-linked notes, are expected to be unwound/redeemed or at least significantly reduced prior to closing.\nWith regard to ENE asset dispositions, these will be accelerated to the extent possible.  However, Doty says that 'our backs are not against the wall', and the company will continue to focus on getting value for its assets as well as cash.\nENE will renew its 364-day facility (believe this is the $3Bn facility that we drew down a couple of weeks ago) within the next 6-8 weeks.  \nBBB-flat most likely rating for combined entity, according to initial comments from ratings agencies.\nMcMahon says 'no comment' to WSJ article indicating that ENE's banks are preparing to make an equity infusion into ENE in the next few weeks.\nConsolidation of trading activity: Mid- and back-office consolidation will see substantial progress prior to closing, such that only the front office / trading books will need to be combined at closing.  EES, NNG and TW have no real overlap with existing DYN activity, so there won't be much integration work required there.  The big integration effort will be ENA.\nWatson says that the 'creative financing' surrounded non-core assets.  Doty adds that, 'frankly', DYN assigned zero economic value to non-core businesses in their valuation model.  They bracketed the maximum expected exposure from the non-core assets/businesses and left it at that.\nWatson mentions that DYN would not have gotten involved with Enron had they not been approached by 'Enron's top three executives', who said that they thought a combination with Dynegy made the most strategic sense for both companies.  Says that their approach evidenced a  willingness to work with DYN to integrate the two companies that made a big difference in Dynegy's deliberations on proceeding with the merger.\nWatson/Doty said that they're NOT 100% sure that no surprises remain in Enron's books--but that the risk/reward offered by the combination was compelling. \nThe deal does have material-adverse-change outs for Dynegy, covering any MAC regarding Enron's assets or businesses.  Dynegy's lawyers indicated that the MAC language was a 'blunt instrument' under which it would be difficult to bring a case, so Dynegy inserted a specific paragraph that gives Dynegy the right to terminate the merger if the Enron's total legal liability (from any source or cause of action) tops $3.5Bn prior to closing.\nMcMahon adds that there 'could' be more restatements, but he 'does not expect' there to be more restatements.\nENE international hard assets definitely on the asset disposition list.\nThe merger structure calls for a new entity to take over Enron.\nEnron is planning to hold an Enron-specific conference call in the next few days, tentatively scheduled for Wednesday.\nInitial reaction of ratings agencies 'very positive' to combined entities.  \nMcMahon acknowledges that Enron would have had to have an additional equity infusion prior to year-end, had the merger not materialized.\nDynegy's earnings guidance places Enron-related earnings accretion at $0.90-0.95, which represents a '25% haircut' to Enron internal estimates.  Doty says that this is all operating earnings--figure does not include any amounts from expected synergies.\nDoty says that both Enron and Dynegy's books, as far as he understands, are relatively short-term in weight, and this will continue to be the weighting of the new entity.  Says a 'very very substantial' portion of future trading earnings will be expected to be cash.\nChevronTexaco's investment in Dynegy was calculated at a 5% discount to public prices on the date of negotiation (not disclosed).  Given the runup in Dynegy stock last week, ChevronTexaco's investment is now at a 'more substantial' discount to market prices.  ChevronTexaco has provision to get 'different prices at closing if those prices are substantially better'.  (No further clarification given).\nWhalley believes that 'we'll retain' the Enron traders and marketers. They're used to being part of a winning team, and the combined entity will definitely be a winner.  They have talked with most of the Enron business leaders, and they are 'very excited' by the combination.  They will be working with the Enron business leaders to ensure talent is retained.  Whalley was asked if there will be any key employee retention provisions.  He says that 'to the extent necessary, yes.'\nWatson says that the trading strategy of the combined entity will be a combination of DYN and ENE--there will be more of an asset-backed trading focus, but by the same token the new Dynegy will be involved in much more financial market-making trading than the Dynegy of today.\nWatson says that if there were to be any change in culture, he's a strong team player.  He does not want to see an individual do well if the company or division does not do well.\n\nGive me a call if you'd like me to try to clarify any of these comments.\n\nPatrick Tucker\nx3-3055",

    "Body": "Dear Potential Gas Supplier\n\nAs some of you may know our authority to buy gas off our existing spot agreement\nwill come to an end on December 31, 2001.  While we will honor current\ncommitments for gas to be delivered after that date, but we will not be able to\nuse the spot agreement to buy any more gas.  The reason that this is happening\nis that our City Attorney has interpreted the new City Charter as not allowing\ndelegations of authority such as employed in the way we buy gas now.\n\nWe are seeking approval for an ordinance which must be approved by the City\nCouncil that will restore our former ability to buy gas with the kind of\nagreement most gas suppliers are familiar.  We have the ordinance approved by\nthe City Attorney and it will shortly be in the pipeline for approval by our\nBoard and the City Council, but until then, this contract is a stop gap to keep\nus operating.\n\nI've attached the new contract and a cover letter which explains what we are\ndoing.  The deadline is November 8, 2001 at 4:00 PM.  We will take the executed\ncontracts to our Board with the counterparties listed on a Board Resolution and,\nif it is approved, we will be allowed to buy gas from this group after the new\nyear begins.  This is not the ideal contract but one we feel our Board will be\ncomfortable with until we can get around the Charter problem.  I can't make any\nchanges to this contract.  There is a notice published in the LA Times about the\navailability of the contract but I am sending it to you directly as someone we\nhave already done business with (and undoubtedly have satisfied all our\nboilerplate requirements) and will probably be interested in what we are trying\nto do here.\n\nI Hope most of you will respond.  Thanks\n\n(See attached file: Spot Gas Cover Letter.doc)(See attached file: New Spot Gas\nContract.doc)\n\n - Spot Gas Cover Letter.doc \n - New Spot Gas Contract.doc",

    "Body": "To add to Charles memo..\n\n1) The Trustees were all present to listen the debate at the stakeholders c=\nommittee. That was very positive.\n\n2) The agenda order was changed to allow ample time to discuss the issues.=\n=20\n\n3) Time and time again it was stated that NERC was running out of time to m=\nake the required transition. If not alternatives would be pursued; example =\nEISB\n\n4) Time and time it was stated that the Goulding task force Recommendations=\n should be taken as a package, as a necessary first step.  These include:\n\n1. Committee Representation . The Task Force recommends that the NERC Board=\n direct the standing committees to modify the standing committees represent=\nation and voting to reflect the Task Force's attached \"Initial Sectors and =\nCriteria Model.\" This Model is based on the Task Force's preference for rep=\nresentation by \"sector,\" and incorporates the Task Force's general recognit=\nion that an RTO sector should be included. The Task Force recognizes that s=\nome work remains to be done to refine the definitions of each sector and th=\ne criteria for belonging, but believes that the Initial Sectors and Criteri=\na Model is an appropriate next step and should be taken immediately. Assumi=\nng that it may take some months to put in place the details of the new Mode=\nl, including the new weighted voting procedures, the Task Force recommends =\nthat two ISO/RTO representatives be added immediately to each of the existi=\nng standing committees to provide formal representation and a voting role f=\nor ISOs/RTOs until the Initial Sectors and Criteria Model has been implemen=\nted.\n\n2. Committee Participation and Voting . The Task Force recommends open part=\nicipation in each sector, subject to certain criteria and qualifications. T=\nhe Task Force has evaluated the qualification criteria and voting procedure=\ns used in several Regions (ERCOT and MAAC), and has incorporated features o=\nf those procedures into the recommended participation and voting procedures=\n. Specifically, the Task Force recommends weighted voting by and within eac=\nh sector, similar to what is done in MAAC.\n\n3. Due Process . The new Organization Standards Process, which will be pres=\nented to the Board in October, addresses most due process issues and concer=\nns. The Task Force recommends implementing this new process immediately.\n\n4. One-Stop Shop . The Task Force favors having a single organization for d=\neveloping Reliability Standards, Market Interface Practices, and Commercial=\n Practices. The Task Force believes that NERC has an opportunity to reinven=\nt itself to become this organization, and should take definitive steps in t=\nhat direction at its October 2001 Board and Stakeholders Committee meetings=\n.\n\n5. Funding . The Task Force recommends that steps be taken immediately to d=\necouple the funding of NERC from the Regional Reliability Councils. The Fun=\nding Task Group recommendations, adopted by the Board in February 2001, sho=\nuld be pursued.\n\n6. MIC Role in Standards Approval . The Task Force recommends, as an immedi=\nate step to address concerns with the current NERC Standards Approval Proce=\nss, and to provide a \"bridge\" until the new Organization Standards process =\nis implemented, requiring the MIC to vote on all new/proposed NERC Operatin=\ng Policies and Planning Standards and report results to the Board, includin=\ng consideration of any minority positions.\n\n5) Lots of discussion about EISB and how NERC may interface with it as a po=\nssible alternative.\n\n6) Silence on the issue of \"self regulating organization\" . No one advocati=\nng that position.\n\n7) Good opportunity to speak with Trustees one-on-one at dinner.\n\nJose=20\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom:=09Charles Yeung/ENRON@enronXgate on 10/15/2001 06:01 PM\nTo:=09mbennett@epsa.org@SMTP@enronXgate, mfgildea@duke-energy.com@SMTP@enro=\nnXgate\ncc:=09James D Steffes/ENRON@enronXgate, Richard Ingersoll/ENRON@enronXgate,=\n Jose Bestard/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT=20\n\nSubject:=09Stakeholder Committee Notes\n\nHere are some bullet points of what transpired at the NERC meeting in Vanco=\nuver this Monday.\n\nThe customers met for almost 2 hours before the start of the SHC meeting.  =\nReps from Enron, Mirant, Dynegy, DENA, APPA and ELCON were present.\n\nAll agreed that a unified voice is needed to show strong direction from the=\n customer side.  This may mean putting aside some internal positions.  Cust=\nomers need to show support of the Goulding Task Force recommendations which=\n offers a package deal to move NERC forward as a single standards setting o=\nrganization for both reliability and commercial issues. The Goulding Task F=\norce recommendations do fall short of asking for NERC action.\n\nAgenda Item 5 - Scope of NERC over Commercial Issues\nTo ensure unity in appearance, customers agreed to maintain discussions in =\nfront of the Independents at a higher policy level.   Many details are need=\ned to get individual entities \"on board\" however, such details should not i=\nmpede on the ability for customers to show strong support on principles, i.=\ne.-one-stop-shop, balance of membership, etc.  Therefore, all agreed to kee=\np details out of the discussion, i.e.-funding, seats, charter, etc.\n\nThe actual SHC discussion was constructive, and persons articulated the nee=\nd for a package deal to the room. The debate brough the expected concerns o=\nf the transmission providers to the surface.  TVA (Terry Boston) was most v=\nocal about keeping NERC out of the commercial side.   Dominion Resources (G=\nlenn Ross) supported the customers' position.  PJM (Phil Harris was also su=\npportive). =20\n\nAgenda Item 6 - Independence of Security Coordinators\nComments made that this is a long standing stalemate at NERC and that NERC =\ndoes not have the authourity to require corporate independence. Suggestions=\n made to perform better and more audits.  Dave Penn brought up the memo fro=\nm Roy Thilly.  Need to ask the Board to bring this issue to FERC for resolu=\ntion.  Good arguments made by customers on need for independence in a new c=\nompetitive market structure.  FRCC (Wiley) made arguments that the NERC sho=\nuld not revamp policies to police the few bad apples.  Should deal directly=\n and specifically with the problem.=20\n\nA straw poll was taken of the persons in the room over recommending actions=\n:\n1) NERC should require corporate indepdence and ask FERC to address it.\n2) NERC should focus in on the problem Security Coordinators and take speci=\nfic actions to safeguard independent judgement (audits)\n\nThe vote was 21/24.  There were strong comments that this vote was not inte=\nnded to be an industry representative vote, only to show how split the indu=\nstry is over this issue.\n\nThe meeting adjourned for lunch and the Independents left after the meeting=\n reconvened.\nThe SHC agreed to ask the BOT the following:\n\n?=09Establish a goal/vision to become the one stop shop for development of =\nwholesale electric industry standards. =20\n?=09Add words that \"we need to go forward from where we are.\n?=09Take immediate action to adopt the initial recommendations contained in=\n new Board agenda item 22.\n?=09Actively solicit cooperation collaboration and support from Canadian an=\nd US government entities.\n?=09Facilitate - jointly with interested trade associations; federal, state=\n and provincial regulators, and other stakeholder organizations - an open a=\nnd inclusive process to achieve consensus on the definitions and attributes=\n of the functions necessary for the development of wholesale electric indus=\ntry standards and practices, an on a course of action to institute such cap=\nabilities.\n?=09Interface with state and provincial regulators to address retail operat=\nion issues as they affect wholesale operations.\n\nAgenda Item 9 -Transmission Expansion\nReference to \"incentive rates\", and \"accelerated amortization\", should be r=\nemoved, not a reliability policy need.=20\nThe reference to these expansion solutions are intended to be tutorial and =\ndoes not assume NERC will begin to undertake rate issues.  APPA - public pe=\nrception will be different.  Must remove this language.  Glen Ross will pre=\nsent this report to the Independents outlining the strong opinions on both =\nsides.",

We have made this information available both on our website and in a Form 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nThe information provides further details about:\n\n\t-- the $1.2 billion charge to shareholders' equity announced in the third quarter and the transactions related to that charge;\n\t-- a restatement of prior years' financial statements to reflect this reduction in shareholders' equity, the consolidation of three entities and prior year proposed audit adjustments and reclassifications;\n\t-- the Special Committee appointed by the Enron Board of Directors to review transactions between Enron and related parties; \n\t-- the LJM limited partnerships, including a discussion of transactions between Enron and LJM entities; and\n\t-- transactions between Enron and other Enron employees.\n\nThis information addresses a number of concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the SEC. As our Board's new Special Committee continues its review of various matters, we will continue to cooperate fully with the SEC in its investigation, and we will continue to respond to investor requests so that they can evaluate, appreciate and appropriately value the strength of our core businesses.  \n\nRestatement of Earnings\n\nBased on information that we have recently obtained, Enron and its auditors determined that certain off-balance sheet entities should have been included in Enron's consolidated financial statements pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles.  As a result, Enron will restate its financial statements from 1997 to 2000 and for the first and second quarters of 2001. These restatements have no material effect on Enron's current financial position.  Here are some details included in the filing:\n\nNet income for each period will be impacted by the retroactive consolidation of Joint Energy Development Investments (JEDI) and Chewco beginning in November 1997, the consolidation of an LJM1 subsidiary for 1999 and 2000 and prior year proposed audit adjustments.  Enron's current assessment indicates that the restatement will include:\n\n\t-- a reduction of approximately $96 million in 1997\n\t-- a reduction of approximately $113 million in 1998\n\t-- a reduction of approximately $250 million in 1999 \n\t-- a reduction of approximately $132 million in 2000\n\t-- an increase of approximately $17 million for the first quarter of 2001 \n\t-- an increase of approximately $5 million for the second quarter of 2001\n\t-- a reduction of $17 million for the third quarter of 2001.  \n\nThe consolidation of JEDI and Chewco also will increase Enron's debt by approximately $711 million in 1997, $561 million in 1998, $685 million in 1999 and $628 million in 2000.\n\nThe restatement will have no material impact on Enron's reported earnings for the nine-month period ending September 2001.\n\nYou can obtain more detailed information on the items described above by accessing the Form 8-K filing at <http://www.enron.com/corp/sec/>.\n\nWe will continue to review our strategic, operational and financial position, and we will continue to keep you updated on any developments.",

Entergy-Koch is sponsoring\nthe event this year which will raise money for the children of Big\nBrothers-Big Sisters of Greater Houston.  BBBS offers youth mentoring\nprograms to at-risk children, and their goal is to match children from\nsingle-parent families with responsible, adult role models.\n\nLast year, our team raised over $1500, and this year our team goal is $3000.\nThe company goal is to raise $350,000 in total.  The minimum pledge per pin\nis $.10 (100 score minimum), or a flat pledge of $10.  Either method works,\nbut be careful on the pledge per pin donation (I have been studying the\nmoves of Roy Munson and Ernie McCracken from the movie Kingpin).\n\nIf you are interested, please reply with your phone number, address, and\npledge amount (you will be billed directly in the mail by BBBS).\n\nFor those of you who are also interested in supporting our efforts in\nperson, the fundraiser will take place on Thursday, March 7th  from\n2:00-4:30 at Palace Lanes, 4191 Bellaire Blvd (713-667-6554).\n\nThanks again to those who could contribute last year.  We hope to have just\nas much success this time!\n\nPatrick D.

    "Body": "Presented below is a synopsis of the 6.75 hour phone call yesterday.   The \nprimary short-term issue facing us is whether we wish to throw our name in to \nbe co-chair.    The only other marketer on the official committee is Dynegy, \nReliant is not on the committee but sat in.    The group generally agreed \nthat the co-chairs should be a financial player (bank, bond or CP) and an \nenergy company (QF or marketer).   After the phone call, I spoke with \nDynegy's general counsel John Herbert, who is their designated \nrepresentative.  He was going to check within his organization whether there \nwas appetite to serve today, but was not all that inclined, given his \"day \njob\" as he put it.   I think we would agree that a marketer should be the \nother co-chair as the QF's have a narrow agenda.  Here are some of the \nplusses and minuses if we threw our name in:\n\n+ Better access to information and guiding consensus\n+ Ability to explain the necessity of long term contracts in the solution\n- time commitment\n- will we be more of a lightning rod?\n\n\nRegards,\n\n\nMichael\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n -----Original Message-----",

During the call, it became apparent \nthat a group of creditors were meeting in a law firm's office nearby.  I \ntherefore walked over and attended the meeting in person.  I learned that \nReliant, Dynegy and Meriant had been in the process of forming an ad hoc \ncommittee which they had invited Merrill Lynch, B of A and some of the QF's \nto join.  That unofficial committee had not gotten off the ground when the BK \nhit.\n\nAll of the official committee members were present either by phone or in \nperson.  Many had counsel present.  In addition, representatives of Reliant, \nMeriant (sp?), the Ohio State Teachers Ass'n and a QF called Crockett were \npermitted to attend.  Finally, representatives of PricewaterhouseCoopers, \nwhich is acting as financial advisors to the Banks, and of Saybrook Capital, \nwhich is acting as advisors to the State of TN, were present.\n\nThe US Trustee made a short presentation regarding duties of committees.  \nAfter they got off the line, the creditors each explained their claim as \nfollows:\n\nOhio State Teachers:  $56M of commercial paper (CP)\nB of A: $938M syndicated loan and a letter of credit supporting pollution \ncontrol bonds\nReliant: generator owed $358M\nDynegy: generator owed $255M\nCrockett: QF owed $55M\nGWF Power: non-gas fired QF owed $60M\nMerrill Lynch: holder of CP and unsecured bonds, but declined to state amount \nat this time\nMeriant: generator owed $220M\nBONY: indenture trustee owed $2 bn\nState of Tennessee: CP holder, owed $76M\nDavey Tree: trade vendor (tree trimming) owed $10M\nUS Bank: indenture trustee on 3 bond issues totalling $310M\nPalo Alto: party to contracts relating to WAPA and NCPA.  owed $50M, but \nclaimed to represent municipalities that could be owed as much as $2 bn if \nthe WAPA contracts are rejected.\n\nThe committee first discussed the SoCal Edison MOU with the governor.  The \nproposal does not help the QF's, as the rates to be paid to them going \nforward do not cover their fuel costs, and doesn't resolve the generator \nissues either.  There also is a major feasibility issue in terms of the \nability of the capital markets to absorb $20 bn plus of bonds.\n\nPGE's lawyers then came in and made a brief presentation.  They said:\n- PGE won't pay out more than it takes in in rates.  They believe there is \nenough money in their rates to pay the QF's at rate set in Woods decision \ngoing forward; they racknowledge that the QF's have been the most hurt.\n- they believe their liability for the net short position was cutoff at least \nas of April 6 as a result of a FERC decision and a decision of the 9th \nCircuit, and may have been cutoff as of 1/17.\n- they will continue to pay the DWR 6.4 cents on an interim basis with a \nreservation of rights.  Will not pay more than they collect.  They expect \nthis to become an issue when the amount they have to pay the DWR goes up to \n9.4 cents.\n- they view the PUC as their adversary and want to use the BKY Ct as the \nforum for financial issues.  They want creditors' support against the PUC.\n- they have hired E & Y as their financial advisors and Ken Buckfire of \nWasserstein as their investment banker.\n- they recommended that the Committee retain a PR firm.\n\nAfter PGE's counsel departed, the Committee turned to organizational issues.\n\nClara Yang Strand of B of A offered to serve as Co-chair.  The Committee \ndiscussed having one of the generators serve as the other co-chair.  Enron is \nthinking about it, as is Dynegy.  During breaks, both Palo Alto and GWF Power \n(a QF) told me they would support Enron to be co-chair.\n\nThe Committee then discussed counsel retention.  A number of firms were \ndiscussed.  Enron suggested Milbank; other members, particularly the QF's, \nobjected because of Milbank's prior representation of the PX.  Eventually a \nshort list was arrived at of Sheppard Mullin; Paul Hastings; Sidley & Austin; \nO'Melveny; Skadden.  These firms will be invited to make a short presentation \non Monday.\n\nThe issue on counsel is that Sidley has been involved for quite some time as \nB of A's counsel.  They seem like the frontrunner for that reason.  The issue \nfor Enron is whether it is comfortable with the Bank as Chair and the Bank's \ncounsel as committee counsel.  This is perhaps less of an issue if Enron is \nco-chair.\n\nNext, retention of a financial advisor was discussed.  B of A tried to \nsteamroll PWC through.  I objected, as did BONY, that we needed more time, so \nthe matter was deferred to Monday.  Right now the only candidate for the \nposition is PWC; do we have any other recommendations?  My understanding is \nthat the remaining big accounting firms are all engaged by CA utilities.\n\nI am a little concerned that the process is heading in the direction of the \nBank as Chair, the Bank's lawyer as committee counsel and the Bank's \nfinancial advisor as the committee's advisor.\n\nWe then discussed retaining an investment banker.  The leading candidate is \nSaybrook Capital.  This was tabled in the short term, although Saybrook was \nasked to send a pitch book to the committee.\n\nFinally, we discussed hiring a PR firm and a lobbyist.  The general sense was \nthat both were a good idea, and names will be solicited.\n\nThe Committee will meet in person in Monday in SF starting at 11.  PGE was \nasked to visit at 2 that day.  Carl and I plan to attend on Monday along with \nMichael.\n\nCall me with questions.\n\nBen Young"

Bonita, my wife, is working since\nhalf a year, and we've moved into a house in Arlington, a short subway-ride\nfrom the office. At one point, we were actually considering moving to\nHouston. We even spent a weekend looking for a house. But we changed our\nmind, it just wasn't worth the effort, mostly because we're planning to move\nback to Stockholm next summer.

I report to Jeff Hunter, he's now the practice\nleader for the Energy Risk Management group. The corporate structure that\nyou knew about is very different from today. When we last met, I worked for\nCap Gemini Hagler Bailly, and the Europeans were all from Cap Gemini. Since\nthen, CGHB has been dissolved (when Cap Gemini bought Ernst & Young\nConsulting), and I went on to Hagler Bailly, that eventually got acquired by\nPA Consulting Group. I still have some contact with Anders Ryrfeldt (his\nwife is expecting a baby in December) at the energy team at Cap in\nStockholm, most of the other guys have moved on.\n\nPA has been doing quite well so far through this downturn. We're in the\nblack, and have not layed anyone off. The last half year has been pretty\nhectic, with work at Shell and El Paso as well as speaker slots at few\nconferences. Have also got a couple of articles published, in the September\nissue of the Risk Desk and the December issue of Energy & Power Risk\nManagement (EPRM).\n\nI'll give you a call next time I go to Houston.\n\n/mattias\n\n\n-----Original Message-----",

Rev=\niews are a leading indicator of the direction of corporate credit.=20\n\"A wide excess of rating reviews for downgrade over upgrades in the third q=\nuarter suggests credit deterioration will persist at least into early next =\nyear,\" said John Puchalla, Moody's senior economist.=20\nMeanwhile, Standard & Poor's said more than 200 companies will default on a=\nbout $100 billion of debt this year, compared with 117 defaulting on a reco=\nrd $42.3 billion in 2000.=20\nIt said the default rate for junk bonds - those rated \"BB-plus\" or lower by=\n S&P and \"Ba1\" or lower by Moody's because of their credit risks - will rea=\nch 9.4 percent by year end. Moody's forecasts a 10 percent rate.=20\n\"The U.S. economy is clearly in a recession,\" said S&P Chief Economist Davi=\nd Wyss in a statement. \"Although Standard & Poor's expects it to be relativ=\nely mild and end in early 2002, the risk of a longer and deeper downturn is=\n high.\"=20\nBoth agencies said the Sept. 11 attacks contributed to a deepening of a thr=\nee-year slump in corporate credit quality. Moody's blamed 38 reviews for do=\nwngrade in September alone on the attacks.=20\nCOSTS RISE, PROTECTION WEAKENS=20\nU.S. corporate credit quality is falling for many reasons.=20\nThese include the weakening economy, the inability of many marginal compani=\nes to raise cash at tolerable interest rates, share buybacks, debt-financed=\n merger activity, and fallout from the attacks on such industries as airlin=\nes, insurance and travel.=20\n\"Many companies in financial difficulties will see their funding sources dr=\ny up and be pushed over the brink,\" said David Keisman, managing director a=\nt S&P Risk Solutions.=20\nEven well-known companies are suffering rating declines.=20\nOn Monday alone, for example, S&P downgraded McDonald Corp. after the world=\n's largest fast-food chain said it will buy back up to $5 billion of stock,=\n at a time S&P said the company's \"growth prospects for the future are less=\n optimistic.\"=20\nMeanwhile, Moody's downgraded Enron Corp., and warned it may downgrade it a=\ngain. The energy trading giant is struggling with vanishing investor confid=\nence, reflected in a share price that has plunged by more than half in two =\nweeks, as it tries to keep access to cash it needs to run its business.=20\nPuchalla said the credit quality decline could slow next year, in part beca=\nuse interest rates are low and companies are managing their balance sheets =\nmore conservatively.=20\n\"Lower borrowing costs and slowing debt growth should reduce debt servicing=\n costs, and fiscal stimulus from the federal government should boost busine=\nss revenues,\" he said.=20\nStill, through Friday, Moody's has said in the fourth quarter it may downgr=\nade 47 companies, and upgrade just four.\n\n\n\nCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Ahead of a potential cut,\nEnron took out bank lines to repay $2 billion in commercial paper\nlast week, largely removing itself from that borrowing arena.\n\n     ``They've pretty much already written off coming to the\ncommercial-paper market,'' said Shannon Bass, who holds Enron\nbonds in the $50 million he helps manage at Pacific Investment\nManagement Co. ``The real issue now is trying to get their house\nin order.''\n\n     Pimco is ``well underweight'' Enron bonds relative to bond\nbenchmarks the portfolios are matched to, Bass said.\n\n                             Shut Out\n\n     Companies such as Xerox Corp., which was shut out of the\ncommercial-paper market a year ago before its credit ratings were\nreduced, were forced to borrow on bank credit lines to access\ncash. Investors in commercial paper, borrowings due in nine months\nor less, also stopped buying Motorola Inc. and Lucent Technologies\nInc. short-term debt, forcing the firms to restructure borrowing,\nsell assets, and find alternative financing sources that typically\ncost more.\n\n     Enron shares plunged $1.59, or 10 percent, to $13.81,\ncontinuing a slide that dates back to Oct. 17, when Enron reported\n$1.01 billion in losses from investments outside its business of\nenergy trading.\n\n     The stock traded near $90 in September 2000 and touched a\nseven-year low of $13.55 today. Enron has lost more than $50\nbillion in market value this year. On Dec. 31, the company had a\nmarket capitalization of $62.7 billion. Today, the market value\nwas $10.5 billion.\n\n                           Deterioration\n\n     While Enron shares have sank about 60 percent in a week, its\nbonds are down about 20 percent. A company's stock typically falls\nfaster than its debt because bondholders have first claim on\nassets after bank loans are paid.\n\n     The company's 6.4 percent bonds maturing in 2006 fell 4 cents\nto 80 cents on the $1 of face value after the Moody's downgrade.\nYields have risen to 12.1 percent, up from 10.8 before that\ndowngrade, traders said. The bonds were trading at 100 cents the\nweek before.\n\n     Moody's said the cut was prompted by the ``deterioration in\nEnron's financial flexibility'' since the write-downs and charges.\nThe partnership investments had not been disclosed before this\nmonth, which ``led to a substantial loss in investor confidence,''\naccording to Moody's.\n\n     ``A credit downgrade will be punitive as far as their\nborrowing power,'' said Joe Correnti, who follows Enron for Wayne\nHummer Investments LLC in Chicago. ``That's not a good place for\nthem to be. They have somewhat aggressive expansion plans.''\n\n     Enron's recent woes had many investors factoring in a credit-\nrating reduction. ``This move was anticipated,'' said Mike Dineen,\nwho holds Enron bonds in the $5 billion of fixed-income assets he\nhelps manage at Mony Life Insurance Co.\n\n     There are about $15.8 billion of Enron bonds outstanding,\nalmost $9 billion of which comes due between 2003 and 2006,\naccording to Bloomberg data.\n\n                            Cash Needed\n\n     Last week, Enron ousted Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow\nafter the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission asked for\ninformation about transactions he conducted for partnerships he\nheaded. In August, Jeff Skilling quit as Enron chief executive,\neight months after taking the position, and Chairman Ken Lay moved\nback into the position.\n\n    Enron is trying to get $1 billion to $2 billion in loans from\nCitigroup Inc., J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and other banks to calm\ninvestors, the Wall Street Journal reported. The company's stock\nhas plummeted 57 percent since Oct. 17, when Fastow's partnerships\nwere disclosed.\n\n    Enron uses its investment-grade credit rating to borrow money\nfor the cash it needs every day to settle commodities trades and\nto keep trading partners.\n\n     ``When you act as a middleman you need high credit ratings.\nIt's likely their trading volumes will go down'' as other energy\nand financial firms seek higher-rated trading partners, said Sean\nEgan, managing director at Egan-Jones Ratings Co., which gives\nEnron's credit a junk grade of ``BB+.''\n\n     Enron's long-term ratings outlook was changed last week to\nnegative from stable by Standard & Poor's. S&P affirmed the firm's\nrating of ``BBB+'', the equivalent of Moody's ``Baa1''.\n\n     ``We have been split-rated before and it did not affect our\ngrowth,'' said Karen Denne, a spokeswoman for Houston-based Enron.\n``We are still investment grade.''\n\n\n\nEnron's Lenders to Demand Harsher Terms, Analysts Say (Update2)\n2001-10-29 16:08 (New York)\n\nEnron's Lenders to Demand Harsher Terms, Analysts Say (Update2)\n\n     (Updates with closing share price in last paragraph.)\n\n     Houston, Oct. 29 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., which can't get\nlow-interest, short-term loans, faces skeptical lenders who will\ndemand increasingly harsher terms as the largest energy trader\ntries to get cash in the bank, credit analysts said.\n\n     ``Anyone providing new funding is going to be nervous,'' said\nSean Egan, managing director at Egan-Jones Ratings Co. ``It's\nlikely that lenders are going to demand collateral.''\n\n     Enron is trying to get $1 billion to $2 billion in loans from\nCitigroup Inc., J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and other banks to calm\ninvestors after a 52 percent drop in the company's stock since\nOct. 17, the Wall Street Journal reported. The company needs cash\nevery day to settle commodities transactions and to keep trading\npartners.\n\n     The company on Thursday tapped $3.3 billion in bank credit\nlines last week to pay off about $2 billion in commercial paper,\nor short-term corporate loans. A week ago, the Enron said the U.S.\nSecurities and Exchange Commission had began an inquiry into\nrelated-party transactions. They cost the company $35 million and\n$1.2 billion in lost shareholder equity.\n\n     ``Banks are in the driver's seat, and Enron is a little\ndesperate,'' said Peter Petas, a debt analyst at CreditSights Inc.\n``I think their interest rates for loans would go up.''\n\n                       Sells Assets for Cash\n\n     Companies in Enron's situation often agree to other bank\nterms in order to secure loans, Petas said. Those can include\nagreeing to use proceeds from selling assets to pay debt and\nputting up assets as collateral.\n\n     Enron is attempting to sell assets to raise cash. Two related\npartnerships, Osprey and Marlin, depend on selling power plants\nand similar assets to repay $3.3 billion borrowed to buy the\nplants. Enron may have to pay any difference between the debt and\nsales proceeds.\n\n     The company plans to complete the $2.9 billion sale of\nPortland General Electric, an Oregon utility, to Northwest Natural\nGas Co. next year.\n\n     Shares of Houston-based Enron fell $1.59, or 10 percent, to\n$13.81.

Internet? Telecom equipment?=20\nSurprise! The stock is Calpine (CPN:NYSE - news - commentary) , and the ind=\nustry is electric utilities.=20\nThree other stocks in the same group have given investors pretty wild rides=\n as well, only to find themselves well off their 52-week highs: AES (AES:NY=\nSE - news - commentary) , Mirant (MIR:NYSE - news - commentary) and NRG Ene=\nrgy (NRG:NYSE - news - commentary) .=20\nThese four companies also have something else in common: Insiders at all of=\n them are signaling that their stocks are oversold. When there is significa=\nnt insider buying in so many related firms, we cannot help but think there =\nis a positive industry trend to profit from.=20\nUtilities may not seem like a sexy sector, but these particular stocks have=\n proved that they can move as well as any small-cap, high-tech play. Their =\nvolatility stems from the fact that the companies they represent are not re=\ngulated utilities paying fat dividends, but independent power producers (IP=\nPs) that derive as much profit as they can from the margins over fuel costs=\n.=20\nIn some ways, IPPs are to regulated utilities what the old English navy was=\n to the Spanish Armada. IPPs are less restricted in the scope and geography=\n of their business movements. This has spurred a more entrepreneurial cultu=\nre at IPPs that often allows them to outmaneuver regulated utilities when c=\nhasing after business opportunities.=20\nThe insider buying at all four companies was obviously interesting. They al=\nl had several insiders recently purchasing within a short time period, and =\nmany of the buyers also had good track records trading their companies' sha=\nres. Several were also adding significantly to their holdings.=20\nAt AES, for example, three of the eight executives that purchased shares in=\n late September for $13 a share or less, were also smart sellers over the p=\nast few years when AES fetched between $40 to $60. And at Mirant, the five =\ninsiders that purchased in September increased their holdings by an average=\n of 53%.=20\nThis confluence of positive insider signals was more than enough to get me =\nresearching these companies and this industry further, and I like what I se=\ne.=20\n\"There's been a lot of talk about if we have an oversupply of energy,\" rema=\nrks Calpine spokesperson Katherine Potter on one of the main reasons IPP st=\nocks are weak now. \"But while supply may be fine right now, you also have t=\no look at the quality of [that] supply. There is such a tremendous opportun=\nity to replace infrastructure.\"=20\nOut With the Old, In With the New\nThe fact is, there are a lot of antiquated power plants and overburdened ba=\nckbones in the power industry, and IPPs stand to benefit tremendously from =\nreplacing the older infrastructure to service the growing demand for energy=\n in the U.S. and abroad.=20\nWith more scheduled and unscheduled maintenance of the present, aging facil=\nities exacerbating price spikes, municipalities and industry would much rat=\nher choose reasonably priced energy from dependable sources if they are ava=\nilable.=20\nAlthough most IPPs use oil, gas, coal or a combination of these fuels to po=\nwer present facilities, the vast majority of plants they're building now ar=\ne a new generation of natural gas-powered turbines that are much more effic=\nient than old gas-fired facilities. An IPP will typically build one of thes=\ne new plants near cities or other areas with high and growing electricity n=\needs, and compete with the older facilities in the region for the business.=\n=20\nBut it's not really fair competition. New plants can generate up to 40% mor=\ne energy from the same amount of gas used by some older designs. The new na=\ntural gas turbines also have a smaller footprint and fewer emissions than t=\nheir predecessors, and can therefore be located closer to where the power i=\ns needed. Can you say lower transmission costs?=20\nSo with the cost of the natural gas representing a good two-thirds of a gen=\nerator's cost, less fuel expenditure combined with a decrease in transmissi=\non infrastructure to pay for leaves more love left for an IPP's bottom line=\n.=20\nAs older gas-fired and nuclear plants are decommissioned, IPPs will continu=\ne to increase the amount of product (and profits) they produce. At the same=\n time, the trend toward more efficient gas plants will help slow the increa=\nses in overall demand for natural gas, and keep the cost of this commodity =\nfrom reaching stratospheric levels.=20\nAlthough, as previously mentioned, IPP stocks are well off their highs, ana=\nlysts are as taken with the group as insiders are right now. Most analysts =\nfollowing the four IPPs I've recommended rate them a buy or strong buy.=20\nThis is not too surprising considering that bottom-line growth for NRG, AES=\n, and Calpine next year is forecast at 24% to 25%, while analysts expect Mi=\nrant to boost earnings per share by 30% in 2002. All of these shares are tr=\nading for 12 times or less the low end of next year's EPS expectations.=20\nChartists will note that the technicals of the IPP stocks I've mentioned st=\nill look weak, and may choose to wait for a better entry point. But longer-=\nterm investors should feel comfortable joining the insiders now.=20\nPostscript\nReaders will note that we have not included Enron (ENE:NYSE - news - commen=\ntary) in our group of recommended IPPs. Although we cannot boast of foresee=\ning its present travails (resulting from too-clever-by-half off-balance she=\net investments), we had ignored it because Enron did not have a positive in=\nsider signal like its peers.=20\nInsiders were still selling Enron as late as Aug. 2 of this year when the s=\ntock was nearly half off its highs, and although there was one insider purc=\nhase in August, there was not a cluster of activity as in the other IPP sto=\ncks we've recommended. There was no buying after Sept. 11.=20\nIf Enron's problems are unique to it, as the industry insiders we talked to=\n believe, this is yet another case of insiders giving investors an excellen=\nt signal of relative attractiveness of stocks within an industry.=20\n\n\nA Debacle Like Enron's Can Undermine the Entire Market\nBy James J.

M=\narlin is now rated Baa2, while Osprey carries a new rating of Baa3, both do=\nwn a notch.\nThe potential issue for the trusts may be \"how much equity Enron would have=\n to issue if the sale of the underlying assets alone isn't enough to pay of=\nf the debt.\" Enron is anticipating using the proceeds from the sale of asse=\nts to meet its obligation.\nLisa Sanders is a Dallas-based reporter for CBS.MarketWatch.com.\n\n\n\nEnron Goes Begging=20\nForbes.com staff, Forbes.com </news>, 10.29.01, 11:40 AM ET=20\n\nNEW YORK - Enron said this morning that it is in talks with banks for addit=\nional credit, as declining investor confidence sent its stock to a six-year=\n low and several large energy groups put their dealings with Enron on hold.=\n Last Thursday, the energy trader drew down about $3 billion from a credit =\nline, causing its bonds to fall sharply on Friday.=20\n\nEnron (nyse: ENE ) has been scrambling to reassure investors and business p=\nartners since Oct. 16--after the company reported its first quarterly loss =\nin more than four years. The $638 million loss included $1.01 billion in ch=\narges on ill-fated investments. A week later, it disclosed that the U.S. Se=\ncurities and Exchange Commission had asked for information on partnerships =\nrun by Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow and other executives. Fastow w=\nas forced to step down from the company last week.=20\n\nThe turmoil makes it clearer than ever that Enron's problems weren't solved=\n by the recent departure of Chief Executive Jeffrey Skilling.\n\n\nIn these challenging times, Enron deserves our thanks=20\nHouston Chronicle, October 28, 2001\nBy BILL WHITE=20\nEnron and its employees have blessed Houston, and many Houstonians should n=\now take the time to say \"thanks\" when the company has experienced some high=\nly publicized challenges. Enron attracted thousands of great people to Hous=\nton and changed Houston's economy forever. The company's management encoura=\nged their employees to be active citizens, and those folks responded by mak=\ning a big difference in their community.=20\nEnron's lead in shaping a nationwide market for electricity gave birth to a=\n multibillion-dollar new industry, with Houston as its hub. Even while it c=\nompeted hard to win in the marketplace, Enron's example helped show other n=\natural gas pipeline and trading firms how to move into the even bigger mark=\net of electricity. The downtown concentration of these firms -- industry le=\naders including Reliant, Dynegy, El Paso and Duke Energy -- led London's Fi=\nnancial Times to refer to Louisiana Street as the Wall Street of electricit=\ny.=20\nThis explosive growth attracted bright young people -- with the average age=\n of Enron employees at under 35 -- and they in turn helped fuel an explosio=\nn in residential growth in Houston's downtown. This, in turn, helped revita=\nlize downtown's retail and restaurant scene. Enron's construction of a larg=\ne Class A office tower, still going up, is a milestone in Houston's growth,=\n an official end to more than a decade of large amounts of vacant office sp=\nace.=20\nVirtually every civic or charitable activity in Houston learned to count on=\n Enron for both financial support and thousands of hours of invaluable volu=\nnteer activities. If Enron or its chairman, Ken Lay, led a visionary effort=\n, such as hosting the meeting of G7 trade ministers, or more recently the p=\nrivate funding of the Houston Biotechnology Center, Houstonians knew it wou=\nld be done right. Without Lay our town would have lost major league basebal=\nl and status as a big league town.=20\nEmployees know Enron set a standard for hiring and promoting employees base=\nd on their potential, with no glass ceilings. Women have run large division=\ns and subsidiaries. Many military officers find that Enron called on their =\ntalents after illustrious military careers, even at ages well past normal c=\norporate entry level. The most highly recruited young people flock to a com=\npany that invests heavily in their training and then lets them rise as far =\nand fast as their talent and ability to work hard would allow them.=20\nEnron's corporate success reflects the stories of so many of its employees =\nwho have lived the American dream. With the habits of work learned on a fam=\nily farm in Missouri, Ken Lay got an education ending with a graduate degre=\ne at the University of Houston, served his country in government and began =\na career in the gas pipeline business. When Northern Natural Gas acquired t=\nhe smaller Houston Natural Gas, Northern's chairman surprised folks by inst=\nalling Lay as his successor. I was at Northern's headquarters in Omaha the =\nweek after the merger 16 years ago when Northern's chairman reassured folks=\n that they could count on \"best young executive in the business, Ken Lay,\" =\nto direct their future in a changing marketplace. Within 15 years, most of =\nEnron's revenues and profits came from businesses that did not even exist w=\nhen Lay had taken over, all of which had been created from within the firm.=\n This success did not diminish the farm boy decency and sense of fairness t=\nhat attracted top talent to his team.=20\nEnron rewarded innovation, while many firms afraid to alter the old formula=\n wondered why their leadership eroded. Year after year, top executives thro=\nughout the country voted Enron our nation's most innovative corporation. En=\nron recognized, even when financial markets do not, that innovative firms a=\nre secure enough to accept occasional failure and the inevitable price of o=\nther successes.=20\nRather than seeking insulation from the international marketplace, as had m=\nany American businesses, Enron welcomed the challenge of the international =\nmarket, confident that American firms could compete and win. Enron also wel=\ncomed the challenge of responsible environmental stewardship, and called on=\n industry to address the issue of global warming even as some companies fea=\nred the impact of pollution control on their bottom line.=20\nEnron's phenomenal success created incredible and perhaps unreasonable expe=\nctations, as early this year when the stock market valued the company based=\n on 20 percent annual growth, forever. Enron's size and success made it a c=\nonvenient target for politicians in California and India, even as Enron sup=\nplied the electricity they so needed. Sometimes it seemed the company's ups=\ntart origins as the David battling utility Goliaths delayed the firm's perc=\neption that it had won and no longer played the role of an underdog.=20\nAnd so if Enron experiences problems, it will learn from them, just as stro=\nng people do. Let's not prejudge Enron's current challenges. The more than =\na decade of my life that was dedicated to trying cases against companies wh=\no hurt consumers and investors taught me both to insist on the truth but ne=\nver to jump to premature conclusions based on a headline or a news story.=\n=20\nThroughout its years of success, Enron folks have never forgotten to find s=\no many ways to make the firm's hometown of Houston a better place to live a=\nnd work. As Enron enters a new phase of its life, let's not forget to expre=\nss thanks and steady support.=20\n\nWhite is a Houston business executive and civic leader and former governmen=\nt official, with no relationship to Enron.",

(DYN)\nENE Deal Shows Risk Coverage & Est & Valuation Upside\n\nSummary\n\nAfter the close on Friday, DYN confirmed that it would acquire Enron (ENE, 8.63,\nStrong Buy) for 0.2685 DYN shares plus assumption of debt and an equity infusion\nof $2.5 billion. This values ENE at $10.40 per share based on DYN's Friday\nclose.\n\nOur initial analyses show the merger to be additive to pro-forma '02 eps for DYN\nby 25% to $3.25-$3.30 vs our current estimate of $2.55. We estimate the deal\nmultiples as about 7x '02 eps, 3.2x '02 cash flow, 0.85x book value and 5x\nEV/EBITDA based on our revised '02 estimates for ENE.\n\nWe would note that DYN has projected a pro-forma '02 of $3.40-$3.50 per share\nbefore cost savings and synergies.\n\nWe expect the deal to close in 9-12 months pending reviews by the SEC, FTC, FERC\nand state PSCs. Despite the size of the combined company, we do not expect major\ndivestitures or closing issues because of the lack of asset concentration and\nthe inherent competitiveness of the natural gas and power marketing business.\n\nIn a report dated Nov 5, we valued ENE at $31 per share. In our view, the deal\nvaluation includes a differential of $20 per share or $17 billion to account for\nENEs related party and accounting issues. Because these issues threatened ENEs\ncore businesses, the timing and valuation of the deal for DYN is extraordinarily\nattractive. We consider alternate bids for ENE to be possible under these\ncircumstances.\n\nWe expect DYN and other energy merchants to benefit from the removal of risk\nthat ENE would be downgraded below investment grade or file for bankruptcy\nprotection.\n\nPending additional information from conference calls, analyst meetings and other\ndeal related filings; we are maintaining our reported eps ests for DYN of $2.10\nfor '01 and $2.55 for '02. Our ENE ests are $1.80 for '01 and $1.60 for '02.\nThese estimates assume the deal closes in 4Q'02.\n\nPrice        Target                     Mkt.

Chief Executive Kenneth Lay finds himself in an enviable position.\n\nLay's employment agreement with Enron, which is set to expire Dec. 31, 2005, allows the executive to terminate his employment with the company 60 days prior to the Dynegy merger and receive a lump-sum payment of up to $80.8 million, according to a regulatory filing Tuesday.\n\n <http://cbs.marketwatch.com/tools/quotes/intchart.asp?symb=ENE>\n\nAccording to the terms of the employment contract, if Lay quits before a change of control at the company, he is entitled to a lump sum payment equal to the number of years left in his contract multiplied by $20.2 million.\n\nThe agreement also allots an amount to Lay for any tax-related penalties if the lump-sum payment is held to constitute an \"excess parachute payment,\" according to the Securities and Exchange Commission filing.\n\nLay's original employment agreement with Enron was amended in August when he became CEO after Jeff Skilling resigned.\n\nEnron's ( ENE <http://cbs.marketwatch.com/tools/quotes/detail.asp?view=detail&symb=ENE>) shares fell 4 cents to $9.20 in recent trading.\n\nLeticia Williams is a

(NYSE: DYN) agreed on Nov. 9 to acquire rival Enron=\n Corp. (NYSE: ENE) for some $9 billion in stock, underlining the dramatic r=\neversal of fortunes for the Houston-based energy trading giant that was val=\nued last year at nearly $80 billion. Enron's stock fell sharply in the past=\n month due to investors' concerns about murky transactions that sparked an =\ninvestigation by U.S. regulators and damaging downgrades by credit rating a=\ngencies. The merged company will retain the Dynegy name. It will have annua=\nl revenues of more than $200 billion and assets worth $90 billion, includin=\ng more than 22,000 megawatts of electricity generating capacity and 25,000 =\nmiles of natural-gas pipelines. It will be North America's biggest marketer=\n and trader of natural gas and electricity, positions previously held by En=\nron.  Analysis: Well, it's now official. The announcement of what presumabl=\ny will be the final chapter in the Enron saga came with much fanfare at the=\n end of last week. It is indeed a dramatic end. Enron, the maverick and inn=\novative company that has often been credited for literally creating deregul=\nated markets in the energy industry, will no longer exist after what has be=\nen a very quick and unbelievable fall from grace over the last several mont=\nhs. Dynegy, the slow and methodical company that took a more traditional ap=\nproach toward success, is making a stunning acquisition of its formal rival=\n and locking in much of the industry market share of Enron. Can there be an=\ny doubt that this is the energy industry's manifestation of the tortoise an=\nd the hare parable? Enron has clearly lost the race to Dynegy, but is makin=\ng a smart choice to be bought, considering its desperate circumstances and =\nthe unlikelihood of its regaining financial strength on its own. For Dynegy=\n, this acquisition is a major win, as the combination will create the  bigg=\nest and strongest energy merchant in the world.   There are so many interes=\nting dimensions to this mammoth deal. Before addressing some issues related=\n to the approval of the deal, let's establish some of the key points of the=\n merger agreement. There have been some mixed reports, but it is generally =\nbelieved that Dynegy is buying Enron for about $10 a share, quite a steal c=\nonsidering that just over a year ago Enron was trading at close to $90 a sh=\nare and had a market value of nearly $70 billion. Under terms of the agreem=\nent, Enron shareholders will receive 0.2685 Dynegy shares per share of Enro=\nn common stock. Dynegy's current stockholders (including ChevronTexaco Corp=\n., which currently owns 27 percent of Dynegy) will own approximately 64 per=\ncent of the combined company, while Enron's stockholders will own approxima=\ntely 36 percent of the combined company's stock at closing.   In addition, =\nDynegy will provide an immediate $1.5-billion asset-backed equity infusion =\ninto Enron to help the company with its current financial woes, followed by=\n an additional infusion of $2.5 billion into the combined company by Chevro=\nnTexaco. Chuck Watson, chairman and CEO of Dynegy, will retain his position=\n at the new company. Steve Bergstrom, president of Dynegy, and Rob Doty, ch=\nief financial officer, will retain their positions at the new company. It i=\ns not presently known what role, if any, Ken Lay, current CEO of Enron, wil=\nl hold at the new company.   Of course, this acquisition could not have tak=\nen place if Enron had not fallen into a very vulnerable spot this year. Qui=\nte literally, Enron was pushed into this deal because it was running out of=\n cash, its stock had tanked and its credit ratings were slashed to near jun=\nk levels, all within the last several weeks. Enron's decline over the cours=\ne of 2001 has been the result of losses in its telecom sector, losses from =\nits involvement in India, the departure of its former CEO Jeffrey Skilling,=\n a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investigation into some of its =\nbusiness practices, and lack of investor confidence about Enron's honesty i=\nn its financial reporting. This last point gained validity last week when E=\nnron announced that it had overstated earnings by 20 percent over the last =\nfour years and investors should disregard the company's financial statement=\ns from 1997 through the first half of 2001. The restating of its earnings f=\nor the last five years sliced $591 million from Enron's reported profits. I=\nn addition, Enron revised its debt upward in each year from 1997 to 2000. A=\nt the end of 2000, Enron's debt was $10.86 billion, $628 million more than =\nit had previously reported. By not reporting this debt earlier, Enron presu=\nmably was able to maintain a stronger credit rating than it would have had =\nthe accurate records been disclosed.   The key value for Dynegy in this acq=\nuisition is Enron's successful energy trading business. In addition, Dynegy=\n could also find synergies in Enron's retail unit, Enron Energy Services an=\nd EnronOnline, the company's electronic trading unit. Dynegy has a similar =\ntrading site known as Dynegydirect, which was launched after Enron gained t=\nhe first-strike advantage in this market space. Details are still emerging,=\n but it would make sense if Dynegy opted to not purchase other units under =\nEnron's business structure, such as the company's water and telecom busines=\nses, which are losing money. Dynegy has its own telecom unit, which has als=\no lost money this year, so it may not want to expand in this slow-growing s=\nector at this time. Vivendi Environnement, a French company that has expand=\ned into various lines of business, has reportedly expressed interest in the=\n remaining subsidiaries of Azurix, Enron's struggling water subsidiary. Not=\ne that Enron sold Azurix North America to American Water Works.   The deal =\nis subject to regulatory reviews and shareholder approval from Dynegy and E=\nnron shareholders. Dynegy shareholder approval may be contingent upon any p=\nossible downgrades on its long-term debt that Dynegy could encounter with t=\nhe purchase of Enron. At this juncture, it does not appear that Dynegy will=\n be downgraded, but this is a fast-changing story and conditions could chan=\nge abruptly. Financing the deal may also be an issue, even with the infusio=\nn of capital from ChevronTexaco. Dynegy reportedly has $3 billion worth of =\ndebt and has a market capitalization of $11.7 billion. Thus, Enron's own mo=\nre substantial debt may be too significant for Dynegy to absorb, a concern =\nthat may cause Dynegy shareholders to veto the deal. This issue could be he=\nlped if Dynegy only elects to purchase some of Enron's assets and if there =\nis some repair work done on Enron's balance sheets.   The issue of regulato=\nry approval could be difficult, as the combination of the two huge companie=\ns may cause regulators to be concerned about market power and antitrust iss=\nues. The review of this merger will be unprecedented, considering that the =\nwholesale natural-gas and electricity trading market is still fairly young.=\n Certainly, a deal of this magnitude has not previously occurred in the der=\negulating energy industry. It is not presently clear which regulatory agenc=\ny will be involved in the review, although the Federal Energy Regulatory Co=\nmmission (FERC), the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department co=\nuld all be involved. FERC would most likely become involved only if the acq=\nuisition includes the transfer of a physical asset, such as a pipeline. FER=\nC may not become involved if the deal is structured solely as an exchange o=\nf stock. Not involving FERC would be more advantageous for Dynegy and Enron=\n as the timeline for approval would be significantly shorter.   An issue th=\nat most likely will be at the top of the list of review items for regulator=\ns would be the extent to which the combination of Enron and Dynegy would ho=\nld market power in the natural-gas trading space, which could pre-empt mark=\net entry by other competitors. The combined company would be considerably l=\narger than its nearest competitors. Scope and scale are considered the top =\ncompetitive assets in the trading sector, and the combination of Dynegy and=\n Enron will certainly have those assets in abundance. It will fall on regul=\nators to determine if the combined company is so large that it precludes ot=\nher competitors from emerging into the same space.   To say that this deal =\nis a sweet victory for Chuck Watson is an understatement. The two rival com=\npanies followed very different paths to success. Enron, under the leadershi=\np of Jeffrey Skilling in particular, espoused an unorthodox belief that the=\n company did not need to own physical assets in order to achieve success in=\n the energy-trading space. Dynegy, on the other hand, approached the market=\n from the opposite perspective, and diligently acquired diverse generation =\nassets across the United States and internationally to support its trading =\noperation. Up until the start of 2001, it appeared that Enron's strategy wa=\ns the more successful of the two. Enron, with $100 billion in revenues and =\n$1 billion in profits in 2000, ranked fifth on Fortune 500's list of larges=\nt U.S. companies. In contrast, Dynegy ranked 54 on the same list and had $2=\n9 billion in revenues and $500 million in earnings. However, 2000 turned ou=\nt to be Dynegy's year and the success continued into 2001, the very year th=\nat would bring Enron's downfall. Enron's problems culminated in $638 millio=\nn in losses in the third quarter, after taking $1.01 billion in charges ass=\nociated with several of its non-core businesses. Taken with the other facto=\nrs plaguing the company, Enron became exceptionally vulnerable and prone to=\n a takeover, which has now provided Dynegy with a strong gain.   The purcha=\nse of Enron will literally quadruple Dynegy's size and should immediately p=\nrovide an accretive earnings contribution. Further, Dynegy claims that it e=\nxpects a 15- to 20-percent annual earnings growth over the next three years=\n following its planned acquisition of Enron. If it gains all of the necessa=\nry regulatory approvals, Dynegy will become the undisputed market leader in=\n the energy industry, with annual revenues of $200 billion and $90 billion =\nin assets. The company will have 22,000 MW of generating capacity, which mo=\nves its closer to the previously established goal of accumulating 70,000 MW=\n by 2005. In other words, the combined company will dwarf any other competi=\ntion in the trading sector and be considerably ahead of its nearest competi=\ntors such as Mirant or Duke Energy in terms of size, resources and assets. =\n  Word of the acquisition caused Enron's shares to increase some, one of th=\ne few upward bumps that the company had experienced in the last few months.=\n Shares of Enron rose 44 cents, or 5.2 percent, to $8.85 in mid-day trade o=\nn the New York Stock Exchange on Nov. 9. As of early morning trade on Nov. =\n12, Enron shares were priced at $9.40. Shares of Dynegy gained $2.24, or 5.=\n8 percent, to $41 in early trade on the New York Stock Exchange.
